.hadithNarrator Mu'adh ibn Jabal
I said to Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him): Inform me about an act which would entitle me to get into Paradise, and remove me away from Hell-Fire. He (the Prophet) said: You have asked me about a matter (which ostensibly appears to be) difficult but it is easy to those for whom Allah, the Exalted, has made it easy. Worship Allah and do not associate anything with him, establish prayer, pay the Zakat, observe the fast of Ramadan and perform Hajj to the (sacred) House (Ka'bah). He again said: Should I not direct you to the gateways of good? Listen to me: The fasting is a shield against evil, the charity extinguishes (the fire of sin) just as water  extinguishes fire, the prayer of a person during the middle of the night. Then he recited: 'Who forsake their beds...(up to)....they used to do.' Then he said: Should I not direct you to the highest level of this matter, to the pillar on which (it rests) and its top? I said: Allah's Messenger yes, (do tell me). He said: The uppermost level of the matter is al-Islam. Its pillar is the prayer and its top is Jihad. He then said: Should I not inform you of the sheet anchor of all this? I said: Allah's Apostle (of course do it). He took hold of his tongue and said: Exercise restraint on it. I said: Apostle of Allah, would we be held responsible for what we say with it? Thereupon he said: Mu'adh, may your mother be bereaved. Will anything else besides (irresponsible) talk cause the people to be thrown into the Hell-Fire upon their faces or on their nostrils?

.hadithNarrator Uthman ibn Affan
When the Prophet (peace be upon him be upon  him) died, some of his companions were so much aggrieved (at his death) that they were disposed to doubts. Uthman said: I was one of them.  While I was sitting there happened to pass by me Umar and he offered me salutation  which I did not notice. Umar made a complaint of that to AbuBakr. Then both of them came and offered me salutation and AbuBakr said: What prompted you to ignore the salutation of your brother, Umar. I said: I never did that. Umar said: By Allah, of course you did that. I said: By Allah I did not perceive that you passed by me and paid salutation. AbuBakr said: Uthman is speaking the truth and something must have absorbed your mind (that you did not take notice of this matter). I said: Yes it is so. He said: What is that? I said: Allah has taken away His Prophet (peace and blessing of Allah be upon him) before we asked him how we could free ourselves from the snares of the world and the devil. AbuBakr said: I did ask about that. So I got near to him and said to him: May my father and mother be taken as ransom for you and you were the worthiest to ask. Thereupon AbuBakr said: I said to Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him), how one could free oneself from the snares of the world and devil. Thereupon Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him) said: He who accepted from me the word that I  presented to my uncle which he rejected is the freedom (from them) (Affirmation of the oneness of Allah and the Apostlehood of Muhammad).

Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him) instructed me to do ten things saying: 1. Do not associate anything with Allah even if you are killed and burnt on that account. 2. Don't be disobedient to your parents even if they command you to abandon your family and your property. 3. Do not deliberately neglect to observe a prescribed prayer for he who neglects the prescribed prayer deliberately will become out of the protection of Allah. 4. Do not drink wine for it is the height of every obscenity. 5. Shun evil, for with evil there descends the wrath of Allah. 6. Beware of running away from the battle-field even if the people perish. 7. And when the death overtakes the people (in a plague or disaster) and you are one amongst them, show steadfastness. 8. Spend on your children according to your means. 9. Do not refrain from using pressure (of punishment) with a view to training them. 10. Inculcate in them the fear of Allah.

Once I was riding (on an animal) behind the Prophet (peace be upon him) when he said: Boy, I would like to teach you something. Be careful and follow Allah's commands perseveringly. Allah will protect you. You should safeguard His rights, and you will always find Him with you; if you need something, ask Allah, and when you need help, solicit Allah alone for the same. Bear it in mind that if all the people combined together to grant you some benefit, they would not be able to do so except that which Allah has determined for you and that if all of them were combined together to do you harm, they would not be able to do so except that which Allah has determined for you.

Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him) said, Satan exercises his influence upon the son of Adam and so does the angel exercise his influence (upon him). The influence of Satan is that he holds the promise of evil and denial of truth. And the influence of the angel is that he holds the promise of good and the affirmation of truth. Thus he who perceives this (i.e. good promise) he should praise Allah and he who finds contrary to it, he should seek refuge with Allah from Satan, the accursed. He then recited this verse: `Satan threatens you with the prospect of poverty and bids you to be indecent.' (2:268)

Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him)  went out and he had in his hand two books. He said: Do you know what these two books are? We said: Allah's Messenger, we do not know but only that you inform us. Thereupon he said: This one which my right hand possesses is a Book from the Lord of the worlds. It contains the names of the inmates of Paradise and the name of their forefathers and those of their tribes. It is most exhaustive and nothing will be added to it nor anything eliminated from it up to eternity. He then said: This one in my left  hand is a Book from the Lord of the worlds. It contains the names of the denizens of Hell and the names of their forefathers and their tribes. It is also exhaustive to the end and nothing will be added to it nor anything will be eliminated from it. The Companions said: Allah's Messenger, (if this is the case) then where lies the use of doing a deed if the affair is already decided. Thereupon he said: Stick to the right course and remain as close to it as possible for one who is to be inmate of Paradise would end his life by an act befitting the inmates of Paradise, no matter what he may have done and for one who is the denizen of Hell, his deed would end on that which is a deed of the denizens of Hell, no matter what he may have done (before). Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him) then threw the books and making a gesture with his hand said: Allah has made a decision about His servants (a section will be in Paradise and a section in the blaze).

(7:172) Ubayy said: He gathered them and paired them then fashioned them  and endowed them with the power of speech and they began to speak. He then  made an agreement and covenant with them. He made them bear witness about themselves (saying) Am I not your Lord. They said: Yes. He said: I call to witness seven heavens and seven earths regarding you and I call witness your father Adam regarding you lest you should say on the Day of Resurrection: We do not know this. Bear this in mind that there is no god besides Me and there is no Lord besides Me and do not associate anything with Me. It is I Who should be sending to you My messengers in order to remind you  My agreement and My covenant and it is I who would send you My Books. They  said: We bear witness to the fact that Thou art our Lord, Thou art our Object of worship. There is no Lord besides Thee and there is no object of worship  besides Thee. They confirmed this (pledge). Adam was raised above them so that he would see them and he saw the rich and the poor, those having handsome faces and even those inferior to them and he said: My Lord, why is it that Thou hast not made Thy servants alike? He said: I wish that I should be thanked. And he also saw the Prophets, some amongst them like lamps with light in them, distinguished by another covenant regarding messengership and  prophethood, viz. the words of the Blessed and the High: And when We made covenant with the prophets - up to His words: Jesus son of Mary (33:7).

Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him) said: There dominate ninety-nine dragons over the unbeliever in the grave. They (constantly) bite him and sting him till there comes the hour (of resurrection). (These dragons are so poisonous) that if one of them exhales on the Earth, no verdure will ever grow upon it.

We went along with Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him) to the house of Sa'd ibn Mu'adh when he died. When Allah's Messenger (peace and blessings be upon him) had offered (funeral) prayer over him, he had been placed in his grave and it had been filled with earth, Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him) extolled Allah (by saying SubhanAllah) and we also extolled Him for a (fairly) long duration. He then glorified His greatness (by saying AllahuAkbar) and we did so. He was asked: Allah's Messenger, why did you (first) extol (Allah) and then glorify Him? He said: The grave had become narrow for this pious servant (of Allah) and Allah expanded it (because of the extolling of Allah and glorifying Him).

Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him) stood up to deliver a sermon and mentioned the trial of the grave, to which a person would be put. And when he mentioned that, the Muslims raised their voices in lamentation. (Bukhari's version ends here, but Nasa'i added:) This lamentation prevented me from understanding the words of Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him). So when the voice of lamentation were calmed, I said to the person who was near me: May Allah bless you! What did Allah's Messenger say at the end of his speech? Whereupon he said (that the Prophet had said): It has been revealed to me that you will be put to trial in the grave, a trial similar to the trial of Dajjal.

Amr heard the Prophet (peace be upon him) say in his farewell address on the eve of his Last Pilgrimage, after he had glorified and praised Allah, he cautioned his followers: 'Listen! Treat women kindly; they are like prisoners in your hands. Beyond this you do not owe anything from them. Should they be guilty of flagrant misbehaviour, you may remove them from your beds, and beat them but do not inflict upon them any severe punishment. Then if they obey you, do not have recourse to anything else against them. Listen! You have your rights upon your wives and they have their rights upon you. Your right is that they shall not allow anyone you dislike, to trample your bed and do not permit those whom you dislike to enter your home. Their right is that you should treat them well in the matter of food and clothing.

When Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him) entered the mosque, he invoked blessings and peace for himself and then used to say: My Lord, pardon me of my faults and open for me the gates of Thy mercy. As he went out of the mosque he would supplicate for  blessings and peace for Muhammad (himself) and say: My Lord, pardon me of my  faults and open for me the doors of Thy favour. In the version of Ahmad and Ibn Majah (the words are): She said: As he entered the mosque and as he came out he used to say: In the name of Allah and a blessing of peace upon the Messenger of Allah instead of praying for the blessings and safety for Muhammad himself.

Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him) was detained one morning from observing the dawn prayer (in congregation) along with us till the sun had almost appeared on the horizon. He then came out hurriedly and Iqamah for prayer was observed and he conducted it (prayer) in brief form. When he had concluded the prayer by saying As-salamu alaykum wa Rahmatullah, he called out to us saying: Remain in your places as you were. Then turning to us he said: I am going to tell you what detained me from you (on account of which I could not join you in the prayer) in the morning. I got up in the night and performed ablution and observed the prayer as had been ordained for me. I dozed in my prayer till I was overcome by (sleep) and lo, I found myself in the presence of my Lord, the Blessed and the Glorious, in the best form. He said: Muhammad! I said: At Thy service, my Lord. He said: What these highest angels contend about? I said: I do not know. He repeated it thrice. He said: Then I saw Him put His Palms between my shoulder blades till I felt the coldness of His fingers between the two sides of my chest. Then everything was illuminated for me and I could recognize everything. He said: Muhammad! I said: At Thy service, my Lord. He said: What do these high angels contend about? I said: In regard to expiations. He said: What are these? I said: Going on foot to join congregational prayers, sitting in the mosques after the prayers, performing ablution well despite difficulties. He again said: Then what do they contend? I said: In regard to the ranks. He said: What are these? I said: Providing of food, speaking gently, observing the prayer when the people are asleep. He again said to me: Beg  (Your Lord) and say: O Allah, I beg of Thee (power) to do good deeds, and  abandon abominable deeds, to love the poor, that Thou forgive me and show  mercy to me and when Thou intendst to put people to trial Thou causes me to die unblemished and I beg of Thee Thy love and the love of one who loves Thee and the love for the deed which brings me near to Thy love.

He then got up and looked towards the horizon and said: 'O  our Lord, You have not created this as something vain.' ... and he recited till he reached 'Verily Thou dost not break Thy promise' (3:191-194). Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him)  bent himself towards his bed and took a Miswak from there. He then poured some water into a bowl from a skin vessel beside him and rinsed his mouth. He then again stood up and prayed till I said (to myself): He has in fact observed the prayer (equivalent) to (the time) he slept. He then lay down (for rests till I said: He has slept equivalent to the time for which he observed the prayer. He then got up and he did that which he did for the first time and uttered that which he had uttered before and Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him) did that three times before the dawn.

Observe Prayer, pay the Zakat, observe the Fast of Ramadan and perform the Pilgrimage if you can afford the journey. Then he added: Shall I inform you of the gates of goodness? The fast is a shield. Charity puts out sins as water puts out fire and also the Prayer in the middle of the night. Then he recited: They withdraw themselves from their beds in the latter part of the night for Prayers and they call on their Lord in fear and hope and spend out of that which We have bestowed on them. No one knows what bliss is kept hidden from them, as a reward for what they used to do (32:17-18). Then he added: Shall I tell you of the root of the matter and of its contours and of its top? I said: Certainly, Messenger of Allah. He said: The root of the matter is Islam, its contours are Prayers and its top is striving in the cause of Allah (Jihad). Then he asked: Shall I tell you of that which is at the bottom of all this? I said: Certainly, Messenger of Allah. Then he took hold of his tongue and said: Keep this in control.

Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him) said in a sermon which he delivered to them on the last day of Sha'ban, "A great month, a blessed month, a month containing a night which is better than a thousand months has approached you people. Allah has appointed the observance of fasting during it as an obligatory duty, and the passing of its night in prayer as a voluntary practice. If someone draws near to Allah during it with some good act he will be like one who fulfils an obligatory duty in another month, and he who fulfils an obligatory duty in it will be like one who fulfils seventy obligatory duties in another month. It is the month of endurance and the reward of endurance is Paradise. It is the month of sharing with others, and a month in which the believer's provision is increased. If someone gives one who has been fasting something with which to break his fast it will provide forgiveness of his sins and save him from Hell, and he will have a reward equal to his without his reward being diminished in any respect." We remarked to Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him) that not all of us have the means to give one who had been fasting something with which to break his fast. He replied, "Allah gives this reward to him who gives one who has been fasting some milk mixed with water, or a date, or a drink of water with which to break his fast. Anyone who gives a full meal to one who has been fasting will be given a drink from my tank (Hawd) by Allah and will not thirst till he enters Paradise. It is a month whose beginning is mercy, whose middle is forgiveness, and whose end is freedom from Hell. If anyone makes things easy for his slave during it, Allah will forgive him and free him from Hell."

It is the distinguisher and is not jesting. If any overweening person abandons it Allah will break him, and if anyone seeks guidance elsewhere Allah will lead him astray. It is Allah's strong cord, it is the wise reminder, it is the straight path, it is that by which the desires do not swerve nor the tongues become confused, and the learned cannot grasp it completely.

.hadithNarrator Ammar ibn Yasir
Ata' ibn as-Sa'ib told that his father said: Ammar ibn Yasir led us in a prayer and did so in brief form. One of the people complained that he had shortened the prayer and conducted it briefly, but he replied that that would cause him no harm, for he had used in it various supplications he had heard  from Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him)." When he got up to depart one of the people followed him (Ata' explaining that this was his father although he made a vague reference to himself) and asked him about the supplication, whereupon he came and informed the people of it as follows: `O Allah,by Thy knowledge of the unseen and Thy power to create, grant me life as long as thou knowest life to be best for me, and take me when thou knowest death to be best for me. O Allah, I ask Thee for fear of Thee both within my secret heart and openly. I ask Thee for the word of truth in  pleasure and anger; I ask Thee for moderation both in poverty and riches; I  ask Thee for felicity which does not pass away. I ask Thee for comfort which is not cut off. I ask Thee for satisfaction with what is decreed. I ask Thee for a pleasant life after death. I ask Thee for the pleasure of looking at Thy face, and longing to meet Thee in a state in which distress does not cause harm or testing lead astray. O Allah, beautify us with the adornment of faith, and make us guides who are rightly guided."

He asked him what objection he had to that when his father had been holding such an office, and he replied that it was because he had heard Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him) say, "If anyone is a qadi and fulfils the office with justice, he should rather turn away from it with neither credit nor blame."

So he praised Allah by His permission and his Lord said to him, "Allah have mercy on you, Adam. Go to those angels (i.e. a company of them who were seated) and say, 'Peace be upon you'." He said, "Peace be upon you," and they replied, "Upon you be peace and Allah's mercy." Then he returned to his Lord who said, "This is your salutation and the salutation of your descendants to one another." Then Allah said to him, keeping His hands closed, "Choose which of them you wish." He said, "I choose my Lord's right hand, and both of my Lord's hands are Right and Blessed." Then He opened it and it contained Adam and his descendants. He asked, "My Lord, what are these?" He replied, "These are your descendants." Now every man's  period of life was written on his forehead, and among them there was a man who  was the brightest of them (or, one of the brightest of them). He said, "My Lord, who is this?" He replied, "This is your descendant David, and I have  recorded his period of life for him as forty years." He said, "My Lord, increase his life." But He replied, "That is what I have recorded for him." He  said, "My Lord, I have appointed him sixty years of my life." He replied, "That is as you wish." He then lived in Paradise as long as Allah wished,  after which he was sent down from it. Now Adam was reckoning for himself, and  when the angel of death came to him, Adam said to him, "You have come before your time. A thousand years have been recorded for me." He replied, "Certainly, but you appointed sixty years for your descendant David." Then he denied, and his descendants denied; and he forgot, and his descendants forgot. The Prophet said that from that day orders were given that a document be drawn up and witnesses be produced.

The Prophet (peace be upon him) asked AbulHaytham ibn at-Tayyihan if he had a servant, and when he replied that he had none he told him to come to him when captives arrived. Two captives were brought to the Prophet, and when AbulHaytham came to him he told him to choose one of them.  He asked Allah's Prophet to choose for him, and he said, "The one who is consulted is in a position of trust. Take this one, for I have seen him praying, and treat him kindly."

A man reviled AbuBakr and the Prophet (peace be upon him) was sitting showing pleasure and smiling, but when the man went on at length and AbuBakr replied to some of what he said the Prophet (peace be upon him) became angry and got up and left. AbuBakr caught up with him and said, "Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him), he was reviling me while you were sitting, but when I replied to some of what he said you became angry and got up and went away." He replied, "There was an angel with you replying to him, but when you replied to him a devil came down." He then added, "AbuBakr, there are three things all of which are true: No one is wronged and ignores it for the sake of Allah who is Great and Glorious without Allah giving him great help for it. No one begins to give intending thereby to unite ties of relationship without Allah providing him with much more because of it. And no one will begin to beg seeking thereby to gain abundance without Allah giving him still more scantiness because of it."

But when you see niggardliness being obeyed, passion being followed, worldly interests being preferred, everyone being charmed with his own opinion, and you see something you are inclined to do, care for yourself and leave alone what people in general are doing; for ahead of you are days which will require endurance, in which he who shows endurance will be like him who grasps live coals.

Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him) stood up among us to deliver an address after the afternoon prayer, and he did not leave out anything that would happen up to the Day of Resurrection without mentioning it. Some remembered and some forgot his words. In the course of his address he said, "The world is sweet and verdant and Allah is putting you as successors in it, so consider how you act. Be on you guard against the world, and be on your guard against women." He mentioned that everyone who had betrayed a trust would have a banner on the Day of Resurrection to the extent of his betrayal in the world, and that no betrayal was greater than that of  the ruler of the common people, whose banner would be fixed onto his posterior.  And he said, "Let not respect for men prevent any of you from speaking the truth when he knows it." One version says "From changing a disreputable thing if he sees it." AbuSa'id then wept and said: We have seen it, but respect for men has prevented us from speaking about it. The Prophet then said, "The descendants of Adam have been created in various categories. Some are born  believers and live and die believers; some are born infidels and live and die  infidels; some are born believers and live as believers, but die infidels; some are born infidels and live as infidels, but die believers." It is said that he mentioned anger, saying, "Some are swift to anger and swift to cool down, the one characteristic making up for the other; some are slow to anger and slow to cool down, the one characteristic making up for the other; but the best of you are those who are slow to anger and swift to cool down, and the  worst of you are those who are swift to anger and slow to cool down." He continued, "Beware of anger, for it is a live coal on the heart of the descendant of Adam. Do you not notice the swelling of the veins of his neck and the redness  of his eyes? So when anyone experiences anything of that nature he should lie down and cleave to the earth." The Prophet (peace be upon him) mentioned debts saying, "Some among you are good payers, but make immoderate demands when a debt is owed to  them, the one characteristic making up for the other. Some are bad payers, but make gentle demands when a debt is owed to them, the one characteristic making up for the other. But the best among you are those who are good payers when they owe a debt and make gentle demands when a debt is owed to them, and the worst among you are those who are bad payers when they owe a debt and make immoderate demands when a debt is owed to them." Then when the sun was shining over the tops of the palm trees and the extremities of the walls he said, "No more of the world remains in relation to what has passed than there remains of this day in relation to what has passed."

Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him) said, Deeds will come. Prayer will come and say, "My Lord, I am prayer," to which He will reply, "You are engaged in good." Sadaqah will come and say, "My Lord, I am sadaqah," to which He will reply, "You are engaged in good." Fasting will come and say, "My Lord, I am fasting," to which He will reply, "You are engaged in good."  Deeds will come in a similar manner and Allah Most High will say, "You are engaged in good."  Then Islam will come and say, "My Lord, Thou art peace (salam) and I am Islam," to which Allah Most High will reply, "You are engaged in good; today by means of you I shall mete out punishment and by means of you I shall give."  Allah Most High has said in His Book, "If anyone desires a religion other than Islam it shall not be accepted of him, and in the hereafter he shall be one of the losers."'

Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him) said, "There are three things which I swear to be true, and I shall tell you something else, so keep it in mind. The three things which I swear to be true are that a man's property does not become less on account of sadaqah; that when a man is wronged and bears it patiently Allah will give him greater honour on that account; and that when a man opens a door towards begging Allah opens for him a door towards poverty. The thing I am going to tell you which you must keep in mind is this. The world has only four types of people: 1) A man whom Allah provides with property and knowledge, in which he fears his Lord and joins ties of relationship, acting in it towards Allah as is due to Him, this man being in the most excellent station. 2) A man whom Allah provides with knowledge but not with property, who says with a sincere intention that if he had property he would act as so and so does, their reward being equal. 3) A man whom Allah provides with property but not with knowledge, in which he acts in a random manner ignorantly, not fearing his Lord respecting it, or using it to join ties of relationship, or dealing with it in a right way, this man being in the worst station. 4) A man whom Allah provides with neither property nor knowledge, who says that if he had property he would deal with it as so and so does and has this intention, the load they have to bear being equal."

When the Prophet (peace be upon him) went out to the prayer and saw the people looking as if they were grinning he said, "If you were to keep much in remembrance death which is the cutter-off of pleasures, it would distract you from what I see. Keep much in remembrance death which is the cutter-off of pleasure, for a day does not come to the grave without its saying, 'I am the house of exile, I am the house of solitude, I am the house of dust, I am the house of worms.' When a believer dies the grave says to him, 'Welcome and greeting; you are indeed the dearest to me of those who walk upon me. I have been given charge of you today and you have come to me and you will see how I shall treat you.' It will then expand for him as far as the eye can see and a door to Paradise will be opened for him. But when the profligate or infidel is buried the grave says to him, `No welcome and no greeting to you; you are the most hateful to me of those who walk upon me. I have been given charge of you today and you have come to me and you will see how I shall treat you.' AbuSa'id told that Allah's Messenger indicated it by interlacing his fingers. Then he said, "Seventy dragons will be put in charge of him of such a nature that if one of them were to breathe on the earth it would produce no crops as long as the world lasted, and they will bite and scratch him till he is brought to the reckoning." He also reported Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him) as saying. "The grave is one of the gardens of Paradise, or one of the pits of Hell."

.hadithNarrator AbuHurayrah
Sa'id ibn al-Musayyab met AbuHurayrah who said, "I ask Allah to bring us together in the market of Paradise." Sa'id asked if it contained a market and he replied that it did, for Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him) had informed him that when the inhabitants of Paradise will enter it they will alight in it by virtue of their deeds. They will then be granted permission for the period of a Friday in this world and will visit their Lord whose throne will be shown to them, and He will appear to them in one of the gardens of Paradise. Pulpits of light, pulpits of pearls, pulpits of rubies, pulpits of chrysoprase, pulpits of gold and pulpits of silver will be placed for them, and the humblest of them, for there would be no one worthless among them, will sit on mounds of musk and camphor, not considering that those who are on the chairs are in a more excellent position than they. AbuHurayrah told that he asked, "Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) shall we see our Lord?" To which he replied, "Yes, are you in doubt about seeing the sun and the moon on the night when it is full?" On receiving the reply that they were not, he said, "Similarly you will have no doubts about the vision of your Lord, and no man will remain in that assembly without Allah conversing with him, till he says to one of them, 'So and so, son of so and so, do you remember the day you said such and such?' and He will remind him of one of the dishonest things he did in the world. He will say, 'O my Lord, hast Thou not forgiven me? And He will reply, 'Yes; by the breadth of my forgiveness you have reached this station of yours.' While that is taking place a cloud will overshadow them from above and rain on them perfume whose fragrance will be such as they have never experienced anything to compare with, and our Lord will say, 'Stand up and go to the honour I have prepared for you, and take what you desire.' We shall then come to a market surrounded by angels, containing such things as eyes have never seen, ears have never heard, and hearts have never thought of. What we desire will be conveyed to us, there being no buying or selling in it, and in that market the inhabitants of Paradise will meet one another. A man of exalted station will come forward and meet one who is humbler than him, though there would be no one worthless among them, who will be charmed by the clothing he sees him wearing, but before their talk comes to an end he will imagine that he has something more beautiful than the other. That is because it is not appropriate for anyone to grieve in it. We shall then go to our dwellings and our wives will meet us and say, 'Welcome; you have come with more excellent beauty than you had when you left us.' We shall reply, 'To-day we have had a meeting with our Lord, the Overpowering One, and it is fitting that we should come away as we have done'."

By the same isnad he said, "Those who are to go to Paradise, who die whether young or old, will come into Paradise aged thirty and never grow older. The same applies to those who will go to Hell." By the same isnad he said, "They will wear crowns, the smallest pearl of which will illuminate the space between the east and the west." By the same isnad he said, "When a believer in Paradise wishes for a child, its conception, delivery and growth to full age will be accomplished in a moment as he wishes."

When these approach their faces they will scorch their faces, and then they enter their bellies they will cut in pieces the contents of their bellies. They will then ask the guards of Jahannam to be called who will say, 'Did your messengers not bring you the clear signs?' and when they reply, 'Yes,' they will say, 'Then make supplication, but the supplication of the infidels is only in error.' They will then ask Malik to be called and will say, 'O Malik, would that your Lord might put an end to us!'

AbuTalib went to ash-Sham (Syria) accompanied by the Prophet (may Allah  bless him) along with some shaykhs of Quraysh. When they came near where the monk was they alighted and loosened their baggage, and the monk came out to them although when they had passed that way previously he had not done so. While they were loosening their baggage the monk began to go about among them till he came and, taking Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him) by the hand, said, "This is the chief of the universe; this is the messenger of the the Lord of the universe whom Allah is commissioning as a mercy to the universe." Some shaykhs of Quraysh asked him how he knew, and he replied, "When you came over the hill not a tree or a stone failed to  bow in prostration, and they prostrate themselves only before a prophet. I recognize him by the seal of prophecy, like an apple, below the end of his shoulder-blade." He then went and prepared food for them, and when he brought  it to them the Prophet (peace be upon him) was looking after the camels, so he told them to send for him. He came with a cloud above him shading him and when he approached the people he found they had gone before him into the shade of a tree. Then when he sat down the shade of the tree inclined over him, and the monk said, "Look how the shade of the tree has inclined over him. I adjure you by Allah to tell me which of you is his guardian." On being told that it was AbuTalib he kept adjuring him to send him back until he did so. AbuBakr sent Bilal along with him and the monk gave him provisions of a bread and olive-oil.

I came to Medina and asked Allah to grant me a good companion to sit with and He granted me AbuHurayrah. I sat with him and told him I had asked Allah to grant me a good companion to sit with and that he suited me. He asked where I came from and I replied that I belonged to al-Kufah and had come desiring and seeking good.  He then said, "Do you not have among you Sa'd ibn Malik whose prayers are answered, Ibn Mas'ud who looked after the water of Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him) for ablution, and his sandals, Hudhayfah who was the confident of Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him) confidant, Ammar to whom Allah gave protection from the Devil at the tongue of His Prophet (peace be upon him), and Salman who was a believer in the two Books?" meaning the Injil and the Qur'an.

Khalid came when he was complaining to the Prophet (peace be upon him) and began to speak roughly to him, with the result that he made him all the more angry.  The Prophet meanwhile kept silent without speaking a word, so Ammar wept and said, "Messenger of Allah, (peace be upon him), do you not see him?"  The Prophet (peace be upon him) then raised his head and said, "He who is hostile to Ammar is hostile to Allah and he who hates Ammar is hated by Allah."
