THE NINETY-NINTH SURAH
AL-ZALZALAH (THE EARTHQUAKE)

1	I.e., all that was hitherto hidden in it, including the bodies - or the remnants - of the dead.
2	I.e., on the Day of Judgment the earth will bear witness, as it were, to all that has ever been done by man: an explanation given by the Prophet, according to a Tradition on the authority of Abu Hurayrah (quoted by Ibn Hanbal and Tirmidhi).
3	Lit., "as separate entities" (ashtatan). Cf. {6:94} - "And now, indeed, you have come unto Us in a lonely state, even as We created you in the first instance": thus stressing the individual, untransferable responsibility of every human being.
