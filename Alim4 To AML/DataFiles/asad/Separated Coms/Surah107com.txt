THE HUNDRED-SEVENTH SURAH
AL-MA'UN (ASSISTANCE)

1	I.e., who denies that there is any objective validity in religion as such and, thus, in the concept of moral law (which is one of the primary connotations of the term din - cf. note [3] on {109:6}). Some commentators are of the opinion that in the above context din signifies "judgment", i.e., the Day of Judgment, and interpret this phrase as meaning "who calls the Day of Judgment a lie".
2	Lit., "does not urge", i.e., himself.
3	Lit., "who are [knowingly] unmindful of their prayers".
4	The term al-ma'un comprises the many small items needed for one's daily use, as well as the occasional acts of kindness consisting in helping out one's fellow-men with such items. In its wider sense, it denotes "aid" or "assistance" in any difficulty.
