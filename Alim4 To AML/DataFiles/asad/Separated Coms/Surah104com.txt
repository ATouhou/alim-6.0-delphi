THE HUNDRED-FOURTH SURAH
AL-HUMAZAH (THE SLANDERER)

l	I.e., everyone who maliciously tries to uncover real or imaginary faults in others.
2	This repetitive interpolation is necessary because the blameworthy attitude spoken of in verses {2-3} obviously belongs to a category entirely different from the two mentioned in verse {1}.
3	This is a metonym for the tendency to attribute an almost "religious" value to the acquisition and possession of material goods and facilities - a tendency which precludes man from giving any real importance to spiritual considerations (cf. note [1] on {102:1}). My rendering of 'addadahu in the preceding verse as "[he] counts it a safeguard" is based on Jawhari's explanation of this term.
4	Al-hutamah - one of several metaphors for the otherworldly suffering comprised within the concept of "hell" (see note [33] on {15:43-44}.
5	I.e., originating in their hearts - thus clearly alluding to the spiritual nature of the "fire" in the sinners' belated realization of their guilt.
6	Lit., "in extended columns", i.e., overwhelming with despair.
