SURAH 31
LUQMAN

1	See Appendix II.
2	See note [2] on {10:1}.
3	The term az-zakah seems to have here its more general meaning of "charity" rather than the legal connotation of "purifying dues" (see note [34] on {2:43}), the more so as the above passage has a close inner resemblance to {2:2-4}, where "spending on others out of what We provide as sustenance" is described as one of the characteristics of the God-conscious.
4	Lit., "among the people there is he who [or "such as"] takes playful [or "idle"] talk in exchange", i.e., for divine guidance: apparently an allusion to a pseudo-philosophical play with words and metaphysical speculations without any real meaning behind them (cf. note [38] on {23:67}). Contrary to what some of the commentators assume, the above statement does not refer to any one person (allegedly a contemporary of the Prophet) but describes a type of mentality and has, therefore, a general import.
5	Cf. {23:66—67}.
6	Commenting on the above three verses, Razi points out, firstly, that the deliberate contrast between the plural in the promise of "gardens (jannat) of bliss" and the singular in that of "suffering" ('adhab) is meant to show that God's grace surpasses His wrath (cf. note [10] on {6:12}), and, secondly, that the use of the expression "to abide therein" in connection with the mention of paradise only, and not with that of otherworldly suffering (or hell), is an indication that whereas the enjoyment of the former will be unlimited in duration, suffering in what is described as "hell" will be limited.
7	See note [4] on {13:2}.
8	See note [11] on {16:15}.
9	This is another of the many Qur'anic instances where the personal pronoun relating to God is suddenly changed - in this instance, from "He" to "We" - in order to indicate that God, being infinite, cannot be circumscribed by any pronoun applicable to created, finite beings, and that the use of such pronouns with reference to Him is no more than a concession to the limited nature of every human language.
10	Lit., "thereon". As in {26:7}, the term zawj has here the significance of "a kind".
11	Sc., "who ascribe divine powers to beings or things other than God".
12	Popularly (though without sufficient justification) identified with Aesop, Luqman is a legendary figure firmly established in ancient Arabian tradition as a prototype of the sage who disdains worldly honours or benefits and strives for inner perfection. Celebrated in a poem by Ziyad ibn Mu'awiyah (better known under his pen-name Nabighah adh-Dhubyani), who lived in the sixth century of the Christian era, the person of Luqman had become, long before the advent of Islam, a focal point of innumerable legends, stories and parables expressive of wisdom and spiritual maturity: and it is for this reason that the Qur'an uses this mythical figure - as it uses the equally mythical figure of Al-Khidr in surah {18} - as a vehicle for some of its admonitions bearing upon the manner in which man ought to behave.
13	Lit., "O my little son" - a diminutive idiomatically expressive of endearment irrespective of whether the son is a child or a grown man.
14	Lit., "his weaning is [or "takes place"] within two years". According to some philologists, the term fisal circumscribes the entire period of conception, gestation, birth and earliest infancy (Taj al-'Arus): in brief, the period of a child's utter dependence on its mother.
15	Thus, gratitude towards parents, who were instrumental in one's coming to life, is here stipulated as a concomitant to man's gratitude towards God, who is the ultimate cause and source of his existence (cf. {17:23-24}).
16	Lit., "something of which thou hast no knowledge", i.e., "something which is contrary to thy knowledge that divine qualities are God's alone" (cf. {29:8}).
17	For mv rendering of latif as "unfathomable", see surah {6}, note [89].
18	I.e., "has enabled you to derive benefit from all...", etc. (Cf. note [46] on {14:32-33}.)
19	I.e., both visible and invisible benefits, as well as both physical and intellectual (or spiritual) endowments.
20	Regarding the implications of the term "Satan" in this context, see note [10] on {2:14} and note [16] on {15:17}. As in many other places in the Qur'an, the above verse expresses an oblique condemnation of the principle and practice of taqlid (see Razis observations quoted in note [38] on {26:74}).
21	See note [91] on {2:112}.
22	For the above rendering of la'in, see surah {30}, note [45].
23	I.e., they give the above answer unthinkingly, following a vague habit of thought, without realizing that a cognition of God as the Ultimate Cause of all existence logically postulates one's full surrender to Him, and to Him alone.
24	Lit., "after that".
25	Cf. a similar passage in {18:109}.
26	I.e., in view of His almightiness, there is no difference between the creation and resurrection of many and of one, just as every single soul is as much within His ken as is all mankind.
27	See note [5] on {13:2}.
28	See surah {20}, note [99].
29	Cf. {17:67}, as well as {29:65}, which says — in a similar context — that “they [begin to] ascribe to imaginary powers a share in His divinity” (yushrikun). The parable of a storm at sea is, of course, a metonym applying to every kind of danger that may beset man in life.
30	For instance, the self-deluding expectation, while deliberately committing a sin, that God will forgive it (sa'id ibn Jubayr, as quoted by Tabari, Baghawi, Zamakhshari). According to Tabari, the term gharur denotes "anything that deludes" (ma gharra) a person in the moral sense, whether it be Satan, or another human being, or an abstract concept, or (as in {57:14}) "wishful thinking".
31	This relates not merely to the problem of the sex of the as yet unborn embryo, but also to the question of whether it will be born at all, and if so, what its natural endowments and its character will be, as well as what role it will be able to play in life; and life itself is symbolized by the preceding mention of rain, and the end of all life in this world, by the mention of the Last Hour.
