THE HUNDRED-THIRD SURAH
AL-'ASR (THE FLIGHT OF TIME)

1	The term asr denotes "time" that is measurable, consisting of a succession of periods (in distinction from dahr, which signifies "unlimited time", without beginning or end: i.e., "time absolute"). Hence, 'asr bears the connotation of the passing or the flight of time - time which can never be recaptured.
2	Lit., "man is indeed in [a state of] loss, except those....", etc.
