THE NINETY-FOURTH SURAH
ASH-SHARH (THE OPENING-UP OF THE HEART)

1	Lit., "thy breast" or "bosom".
2	I.e., "the burden of thy past sins, which are now forgiven" (Tabari, on the authority of Mujahid, Qatadah, Ad-Dahhak and Ibn Zayd). In the case of Muhammad, this relates apparently to mistakes commited before his call to prophethood (ibid.), and is obviously an echo of {93:7} - 'Has He not found thee lost on thy way, and guided thee?"
3	Or: "raised high thy renown". The primary meaning of the term dhikr is "reminder" or "remembrance"; and, secondarily, "that by which something [or "someone"] is remembered", i.e., with praise: hence, it signifies "fame" or "renown", and, tropically - as in the present context - "eminence" or "dignity".
