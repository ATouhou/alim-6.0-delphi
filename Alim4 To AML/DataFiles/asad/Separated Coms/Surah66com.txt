THE SIXTY-SIXTH SURAH
AT-TAHRIM (PROHIBITION)

1	There are several essentially conflicting - and, therefore, in their aggregate, not very trustworthy - reports as to the exact reason or reasons why, at some time during the second half of the Medina period, the Prophet declared on oath that for one month he would have no intercourse with any of his wives. Still, while the exact reason cannot be established with certainty, it is sufficiently clear from the above-mentioned ahadith that this emotional, temporary renunciation of marital life was caused by a display of mutual jealousy among some of the Prophet's wives. In any case, the purport of the above Qur'anic allusion to this incident is not biographical but, rather, intended to bring out a moral lesson applicable to all human situations: namely, the inadmissibility of regarding as forbidden (haram) anything that God has made lawful (halal), even if such an attitude happens to be motivated by the desire to please another person or other persons. Apart from this, it serves to illustrate the fact - repeatedly stressed in the Qur'an - that the Prophet was but a human being, and therefore subject to human emotions and even liable to commit an occasional mistake (which in his case, however, was invariably pointed out to him, and thus rectified, through divine revelation).
2	See {2:224} and the corresponding note [212], which shows that in certain circumstances an oath should be broken and then atoned for: hence the above phrase, "God has enjoined upon you the breaking and expiation" (with the term tahillah comprising both these concepts).
3	See surah {2}, note [21].
4	Lit., "he turned aside from [or "avoided"] some of it". There is no reliable Tradition as to the subject of that confidential information. Some of the early commentators, however, connect it with the Prophet's veiled prediction that Abu Bakr and 'Umar ibn al-Khattab would succeed him as leaders of the Muslim community; the recipient of the information is said to have been Hafsah, the daughter of 'Umar, and the one to whom she disclosed it, 'A'ishah, the daughter of Abu Bakr (Baghawi, on the authority of Ibn'Abbas and Al-Kalbi; also Zamakhshari). If this interpretation is correct, it would explain why the Prophet "acquainted [others] with some of it and passed over some of it": for, once his confidential prediction had been divulged, he saw no point in withholding it any longer from the community; nevertheless, he alluded to it in deliberately vague terms - possibly in order not to give to the succession of Abu Bakr and 'Umar the appearance of an "apostolic sanction" but to leave it, rather, to a free decision of the community in pursuance of the Qur'anic principle amruhum shura baynahum (see {42:38}).
5	I.e., that she had broken the Prophet's confidence.
6	Although in the sequence the Prophet is referred to in the third person, it is obvious that it is he who is commanded through revelation to speak thus to his wives Hafsah and 'A'ishah (see note [4]); hence my above interpolation.
7	Referring to Hafsah, who betrayed the Prophet's confidence, and to 'A'ishah, who by listening contributed to this betrayal (see note [4] above).
8	Lit., "after that", i.e., in consequence of the fact that God Himself protects him.
9	For this rendering of the expression sa'ihat, see note [147] on {9:112}, where the same expression occurs in the masculine gender relating to both men and women.
10	I.e., like the actual wives of the Prophet, one of whom ('A'ishah) was a virgin when she married him, one (Zaynab bint Jahsh) had been divorced, while the others were widows. This allusion, together with the fact that the Prophet did not divorce any of his wives, as well as the purely hypothetical formulation of this passage, shows that it is meant to be an indirect admonition to the Prophet's wives, who, despite their occasional shortcomings - unavoidable in human beings - did possess the virtues referred to above. On a wider plane, it seems to be an admonition to all believers, men and women alike: and this explains the subsequent change in the discourse.
11	Lit., "your families" or "your people"; however, the term ahl denotes also people who share one's race, religion, occupation, etc., as well as "dependents" in the most comprehensive sense of this word (Jawhari, Raghib; also Mughni).
12	See surah {2}, note [16].
13	See {74:27} ff. and the corresponding notes, particularly notes [15] and [16], in which I have tried to explain the allegorical meaning of that passage.
14	I.e., these angelic powers are subject to the God-willed law of cause and effect which dominates the realm of the spirit no less than the world of matter.
15	I.e., "do not try to rationalise your deliberate denial of the truth" - the element of conscious intent being implied in the past-tense phrase alladhina kafaru (see note [6] on {2:6}).
16	Sc., "since no human being, however imbued with faith, can ever remain entirely free from faults and temptations".
17	The implication is that He will not only "not shame" the Prophet and his followers but will, on the contrary, exalt them: an idiomatic turn of phrase similar to sayings like "I shall let you know something that will not be to your detriment" - i.e., "something that will benefit you".
18	Cf. {57:12} and the corresponding note [12].
19	Lit., "Complete for us our light", i.e.' by making it permanent.
20	See note [101] on {9:73}, which is identical with the above verse.
21	Lit., "and both betrayed them", i.e., their respective husbands. The story of Lot's wife and her spiritual betrayal of her husband is mentioned in the Qur'an in several places; see, in particular, note [66] on {7:83} and note [113] on {11:81}. As regards Noah's wife, the above is the only explicit reference to her having betrayed her husband; it would seem, however, that the qualification of "those on whom [God's] sentence has already been passed" in {11:40} applies to her no less than to her son (whose story appears in {11:42-47}).
22	The "parable" (mathal) of these two women implies, firstly, that even the most intimate relationship with a truly righteous person - even though he be a prophet - cannot save an unrepentant sinner from the consequences of his sin; and, secondly, that a true believer must cut himself off from any association with "those who are bent on denying the truth" even if they happen to be those nearest and dearest to him (cf.{ll:46}).
23	Cf. {28:8-9}.
24	I.e., a descendant of the House of 'Imran (cf. the last third of note [22] on {3:33}).
25	I.e., into the as yet unborn child (Razi, thus explaining the pronoun in fihi). For an explanation of the much-misunderstood allegorical phrase, "We breathed of Our spirit into it", see note [87] on {21:91}.
26	For the meaning of God's "words" (kalimat), see note [28] on {3:39}.
