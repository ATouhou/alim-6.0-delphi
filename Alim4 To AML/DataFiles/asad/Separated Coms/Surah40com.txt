SURAH 40
GHAFIR

1	See Appendix II.
2	Cf. {{38:12-14}}, where some of those who were "leagued together" (al-ahzab) are enumerated; also verses {30} ff. of this surah. 
3	Lit., "each community schemed against their apostle". 
4	Lit, "around it": cf. Zamakhsharis explanation of the expression hawlaha occurring in {27:8} in the sense of "near it". In his commentary on the verse which we are now considering, Baydawi states explicitly that the "bearing" of God's throne of almightiness (al-'arsh - see note [43] on {7:54}) must be understood in a metaphorical sense: "Their carrying it and surrounding it [or "being near it"] is a metaphor of their being mindful of it and acting in accordance therewith (majaz 'an hifzihim wa-tadbirihim lahu), or a metonym (kinayah) for their closeness to the Lord of the Throne, their dignity in His sight, and their being instrumental in the realization of His will." My rendering of the above verse reflects Baydawi's interpretation. - As regards the beings which are said to be close to the throne of God's almightiness, most of the classical commentators obviously basing their view on the symbolic image of "the angels surrounding the throne of [God's] almightiness" on the Day of Judgment ({39:75}) - think in this instance, too, exclusively of angels. But whereas it cannot be denied that the present verse refers also to angels, it does not follow that it refers exclusively to them. In its abstract connotation, the verb hamala frequently signifies "he bore [or "took upon himself"] the responsibility [for something]": and so it is evident that it applies here not only to angels but also to all human beings who are conscious of the tremendous implications of the concept of God's almightiness, and hence feel morally responsible for translating this consciousness into the reality of their own and their fellow-beings' lives. 
5	See note [45] on {38:50}.
6	Lit., "they will be called" or "summoned". 
7	I.e., "on realizing, belatedly, your past sinfulness". 
8	Since it is impossible to attribute to God a purely human emotion, "God's loathing" of those sinners is obviously a metonym for His rejection of them (Razi), similar to the metonymic use of the expression "God's wrath (ghadab)" in the sense of His condemnation (see first sentence of note [4] on {1:7}). 
9	I.e., "Thou hast brought us to life on earth, and then hast caused us to die; thereupon Thou hast resurrected us, and now hast condemned us to spiritual death in consequence of our wilful spiritual blindness on earth." 
10	An answer to the sinners' question at the end of the preceding verse may be found in the following extremely well-authenticated, parabolic saying of the Prophet: "[On the Day of Judgment,] those who deserve paradise will enter paradise, and those who deserve the fire, the fire. Thereupon God, the Sublimely Exalted, will say, 'Take out [of the fire] everyone in whose heart there was as much of faith [or, in some versions, "as much of good"] as a grain of mustard seed!' And so they will be taken out of it, already blackened, and will be thrown into the River of Life; and then they will come to life [lit., 'sprout'] as a herb sprouts by the side of a stream: and didst thou not see how it comes out, yellow and budding?" (Bukhari, on the authority of Abu Sa'id al-Khudri, in Kitab al-Iman and Kitab Bad' al-Khalq; also Muslim, Nasai and Ibn Hanbal.) The characterization as "yellow and budding" - i.e., tender and of light colour - indicates the freshness of new life in the pardoned sinner. This, of course, has nothing to do with the sinners' futile - because meaningless - request on Judgment Day to be given a "second chance" on earth (Cf. {6:27-28} or {32:12}). See also last but one sentence of {6:128} and the corresponding note [114].
11	Lit., He of the throne of almightiness". For the meaning of the term 'arsh, see note [43] on {7:54}. 
12	Lit., the Day of the Meeting". - For my rendering of ar-ruh as inspiration, see note [2] on {16:2}, as well as note [71] on {2:87}. 
13	Regarding the problem of "intercession" (shafaah) and its meaning in the Qur an, see note [7] on {10:3}. 
14	God's omniscience is shown here as the reason why there can be no intercession with Him in the commonly-accepted sense of this term (cf. surah {10}, note [27]). 
15	I.e., saints, whether real or imaginary, or angels. (The pronoun alladhina is used only with reference to sentient beings endowed with reason.) 
16	As regards Qarun, who is said to have been a follower - and subsequently an opponent - of Moses, see {28:76} ff., as well as the corresponding note [84]. For a discussion of the name Haman, see note [6] on {28:6}.
17	Lit., "those who have come to believe with him". 
18	My interpolation of the word "alleged", is necessitated by the obvious sarcasm of Pharaoh's remark. 
19	Cf. the parable of the believer in {36:20-27} and, in particular, the corresponding note 15. 
20	Lit., "a liar". As regards my rendering of musaf as "one who wastes [or "has wasted"] his own self", see note [21] on the last sentence of {10:12}. Thus, the anonymous believer spoken of here argues that the message brought by Moses is so convincing that, by itself, it is a proof of his not being "one who wastes his own self" - i.e., destroys himself spiritually-by a spurious claim to divine inspiration. 
21	Thus alluding to the reasons underlying his intention to kill Moses, expressed in verse {26}. 
22	I.e., those sinners were not wronged by what befell them in this world: they had deserved it. The next two verses refer to the Day of Judgment. 
23	See note [152] on {7:186} and note [4] on {14:4}. 
24	Thus not only refusing to acknowledge Joseph's prophethood, but also denying the possibility of any prophet being sent by God (Zamakhshari). It would seem that Joseph had been accepted in Egypt as a prophet only by the ruling class, the Hyksos, who were of Arab origin; spoke a language closely related to Hebrew (cf. surah {12}, note [44]), and were, therefore, emotionally and culturally predisposed towards the spirit of Joseph's mission, while the rest of the population was and remained hostile to the faith preached by him. 
25	Lit., "without any authority [or "evidence"] having come to them": i.e., without having any cogent evidence that would support their "denial" of the fact of revelation. - The verb jadala primarily denotes "he argued"; followed by the particle fi ("with regard to" or "about") it has the meaning of "contesting" the truth of something, or "calling it in question". 
26	Lit., "on the heart of every arrogant, self-exalting [person]". For an explanation of God's "sealing" an inveterate sinner's heart. see note [7] on {2:7}. 
27	See surah {28}, notes [6] and [37]. 
28	I.e., beyond any earthly imagination. The concept of rizq (expressed in the verb yurzaqun) has here its full significance of all that is good and of benefit to a living being, comprising things material as well as intellectual and spiritual; hence my rendering of yurzaqun (lit., "they will be given sustenance") as "they shall be blest with good". 
29	Lit., "what is the matter with me": an expression of astonishment at the incongruity of the two attitudes referred to in the sequence. 
30	I.e., because there is no reality whatsoever in those supposedly "divine" beings or forces (Zamakhshari). 
31	I.e., of which they had been warned, day-in and day-out, by prophets and believers like the one spoken of in this passage.
32	Cf. {14:21} and the corresponding notes [28] and [29]. 
33	I.e., the angelic forces that are to watch over the suffering of the sinners in the hereafter: perhaps an allegory of the belated awakening of the latters' conscience. 
34	According to the classical commentators, this answer implies no more than a refusal on the part of the "keepers of hell" to intercede for the doomed sinners, telling them, as it were, "Pray yourselves, if you can." It seems to me, however, that we have here an indirect allusion to the sinners' erstwhile, blasphemous devotion to false objects of worship and false values - the meaning being, "Pray now to those imaginary powers to which you were wont to ascribe a share in God's divinity, and see whether they can help you!" This interpretation finds support in the next sentence, which speaks of the delusion (dalal) inherent in the prayers of "those who deny the truth", i.e., during their life on earth - for, obviously, on the Day of Judgment all such delusions will have disappeared. 
35	See note [71] on {39:69}. 
36	Lit., "the evil of the [otherworldly] abode". As regards the term la'nah, its primary significance is "estrangement" or "rejection"; in Qur'anic terminology it denotes "rejection from all that is good" (Lisan al-'Arab) and, specifically, "estrangement from Cod's grace" (Zamakhshari). 
37	Sc., "and thus, too, have We bestowed Our revelation upon Muhammad". This connects with the opening words of verse {51}, "We shall indeed succour Our apostles and those who have attained to faith", thus explaining the purport of the preceding story of the believer who stood up for Moses. The reference to "those [of the children of Israel] who were endowed with insight" and therefore could benefit from the message of Moses, is undoubtedly meant to remind the followers of the Our'an that this divine writ, too, is for "those who are endowed with insight" (u-lu 'I-albab), for "people who think" (qawm yatafakkarun), and "people who use their reason" (qawm ya qilun). 
38	According to all classical commentators, the above passage is addressed in the first instance to the Prophet and, through him, to every believer. As regards the Prophet himself, see note [41] on the last sentence of {24:31}. 
39	See note [25] above. 
40	Lit., "which they will never [be able to] reach" or "fulfil". This is a reference to the conceit which makes many agnostics think that man is "self-sufficient" and that, therefore, there are no limits to what he may yet achieve, and no need to assume that he is responsible to a higher Power. Cf. in this connection {96:6-7}, which is one of the earliest Qur'anic revelations: "Nay, verily, man becomes grossly overweening whenever he believes himself to be self-sufficient." And since this "self-sufficiency" is entirely illusory, those who build their world-view on it "will never be able to satisfy their overweening conceit". (Cf. also the reference to "arrogant, self-exalting hearts" in verse {35} above.) 
41	I.e., of the universe as a whole. By stressing the fact that man is only a small, insignificant part of the universe, the Qur'an points out the absurdity of the man-centred world-view alluded to in the preceding verse. 
42	I.e., refuse to admit to themselves that the world as they know it could ever come to an end: which is another aspect of the "overweening conceit" spoken of in verse {56} above. 
43	Cf. {2:186}. 
44	See note [77] on {27:86}.
45	Sc., "O you who deny this truth!" For my above rendering of tu'fakun, see note [90] on the last sentence of {5:75}. 
46	See surah {29}, note [45]. 
47	I.e., in accordance with the exigencies of human life. See also note [9] on the first sentence of {7:11}. 
48	See note [4] on {23:12}. 
49	Or: "a term known [only to Him]" - cf. {6:2} and the corresponding note [2]. 
50	Lit., "how they are turned away" - i.e., from the truth: in this case, from all the observable evidence of God's almightiness and creative activity. 
51	Since, as the Qur'an so often points out, the fundamental truths set forth in all divine revelations are the same, a rejection of the last of them amounts to a rejection of all the preceding ones.
52	For an explanation of the allegory of "shackles" and "chains", see note [13] on {13:5}, note [44] on the last but one sentence of {34:33}, and notes [6] and [7] on {36:8}. 
53	Thus Mujahid (as quoted by Tabari) explains the verb yusjarun. As regards my rendering of hamim as "burning despair", see surah {6}, note [62]. 
54	Lit., "we have not been invoking aforetime any [real] thing": thus realizing, belatedly, the intrinsic nothingness of all those imaginary powers and values - including the belief in man's alleged self-sufficiency and greatness - to which they paid homage in life. 
55	I.e., by allowing them to pursue illusions and foolish fancies in consequence of their unwillingness to acknowledge the self-evident truth of God's existence and uniqueness and of man's utter dependence on Him. For a discussion of the problem of God's "letting" a sinner go astray, see note [4] on {14:4}. 
56	See the almost identical passage in {10:46}, as well as the corresponding notes [66] and [67]. 
57	I.e., in the Qur'an. 
58	See {6:109} - "Miracles are in the power of God alone" - and the corresponding note [94]. Both passages (6:109 and the present one) relate to the futile demand of Muhammad's opponents to be shown a miracle in proof of the divine origin of the Qur'an - the implication being that it is not God's will to convince the deniers of the truth by means of what is commonly regarded as miracles ".
59	Lit., "when God's command comes", i.e., whether it be in this world or on the Day of Judgment: a reference to the retribution spoken of in verse {77} above. 
60	I.e., in this case, divine revelation as such. For the above rendering of al-mubtilun, see note [47] on the last sentence of {29:48}. 
61	I.e., by providing in a wondrous manner the means of man's subsistence, and by endowing him with the miracle of a creative intellect which enables him to make fruitful use of so many natural phenomena. (This passage connects with the statement implied in verse {78} that "miracles are in the power of God alone": see note [58].) 
62	The "other benefits" are both concrete and abstract in their nature: concrete benefits like wool, skins, etc., and abstract ones like beauty (cf. {16:6-8}, as well as Solomon's reverence for the God-created beauty of horses expressed in {38:31-33}) or the all-time companionship of man and dog symbolized in the legend of the Men of the Cave ({18:18} and {22}). 
63	Lit., "a need in your bosoms" [or "hearts"]: i.e., a genuine need. 
64	I.e., they were fully satisfied with their own empirically or speculatively acquired or inherited knowledge; and so, in their arrogant conviction that man is "self-sufficient" and, therefore, not in need of any guidance by a Power beyond the reach of human perception, they rejected whatever ethical and spiritual truths were offered them by the prophets. 
65	I.e., the idea of God's existence and inescapable judgment: see {6:10} and the corresponding note [9]. 
66	I.e., the God-willed, catastrophic breakdown of their society and civilization in consequence of their persistent rejection of all spiritual values.
67	This evidently includes their past belief in man's supposedly "unlimited possibilities" and the illusory conviction that one day he would achieve "mastery over nature". 
68	I.e., firstly, because this belated faith could not unmake a reality which had already come into being, and, secondly, because it could not contribute to their spiritual growth inasmuch as it was not an outcome of free choice but had been, rather, forced on them by the shock of an irreversible calamity. 
69	The "way of God" (sunnat Allah) is the Qur'anic term for the totality of natural laws instituted by the Creator: in this case, the law that faith has no spiritual value unless it arises out of a genuine, inner enlightenment.
