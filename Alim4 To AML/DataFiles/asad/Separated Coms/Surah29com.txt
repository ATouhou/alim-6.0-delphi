SURAH 29
AL-'ANKABUT (THE SPIDER)

1	See Appendix II.
2	I.e., to others and/or to themselves (see note [7]).
3	Cf. {31:14-15} and, particularly, the corresponding note [15].
4	Lit., "something of which thou hast no knowledge": i.e., in this particular case, "something which conflicts with thy knowledge that none and nothing can have any share in God's qualities or powers". According to Razi, this phrase may also allude to concepts not evolved through personal knowledge but, rather, acquired through a blind, uncritical acceptance of other people's views (taqlid).
5	I.e., the suffering which is bound to befall in the hereafter all who abandon their faith for fear of being persecuted in this world. (It is to be borne in mind that a mere outward renunciation of faith under torture or threat of death is not considered a sin in Islam, although martyrdom for the sake of one's faith is the highest degree of merit to which man can attain.)
6	I.e., when it is no longer risky to be counted as one of them.
7	This is probably the earliest occurrence of the term munafiq in the chronology of Qur'anic revelation. Idiomatically, the term is derived from the noun nafaq, which denotes an "underground passage" having an outlet different from the entry, and signifying, specifically, the complicated burrow of a field-mouse, a lizard, etc., from which the animal can easily escape or in which it can outwit a pursuer. Tropically, the term munafiq describes a person who is "two-faced", inasmuch as he always tries to find an easy way out of any real commitment, be it spiritual or social, by adapting his course of action to what promises to be of practical advantage to him in the situation in which he happens to find himself. Since a person thus characterized usually pretends to be morally better than he really is, the epithet munafiq may roughly be rendered as "hypocrite". It should, however, be noted that whereas this Western term invariably implies conscious dissembling with the intent to deceive others, the Arabic term mun afiq may also be applied - and occasionally is applied in the Qur'an - to a person who, being weak or uncertain in his beliefs or moral convictions, merely deceives himself. Hence, while using in my rendering of the Qur'anic text the conventional expression "hypocrite", I have endeavoured to point out the above differentiation, whenever possible and necessary, in my explanatory notes.
8	The above "saying" of the deniers of the truth is, of course, but a metonym for their attitude towards the believers; hence my interpolation, between brackets, of the words "as it were". The implication is that people who deny the validity of any spiritual commitment arising out of one’s faith in "something that is beyond the reach of human perception" (al-ghayb) - in this case, the existence of God - are, as a rule, unwilling to tolerate such a faith and such a commitment in others as well: and so they endeavour to bring the believers to their way of thinking by a sarcastic, contemptuous reference to the alleged irrelevance of the concept of "sin" as such.
9	Lit., "bear" - implying a reduction of the burden which the others would have to bear (Razi) See also next note.
10	Cf. the Prophet's saying: "Whoever calls [others] unto the right way shall have a reward equal to the [combined] rewards of all who may follow him until Resurrection Day, without anything being lessened of their rewards; and whoever calls unto the way of error will have to bear a sin equal to the [combined] sins of all who may follow him until Resurrection Day, without anything being lessened of their sins" (Bukhari).
11	This passage connects with verse {2} above, "We did test those who lived before them". The story of Noah and of his failure to convert his people occurs in the Qur'an several times, and most extensively in {11:25-48}. In the present instance it is meant to illustrate the truth that no one - not even a prophet - can bestow faith on another person (cf. {28:56} - "thou canst not guide aright everyone whom thou lovest"). The same purport underlies the subsequent references, in verses {16-4O}, to other prophets.
12	Sc., "and despite this great length of time was unable to convince them of the truth of his mission". The identical figure - 950 years - is given in the Bible (Genesis ix, 29) as Noah's life-span. By repeating this element of the Biblical legend, the Qur'an merely stresses the fact that the duration of a prophet's mission has nothing to do with its success or failure, since "all true guidance is God's guidance" ({3:73}) - and, as we are so often told in the Qur'an, "God guides [only] him that wills [to be guided]". Thus, the reference to Noah is meant to reassure the believer who may be distressed at seeing the majority of his fellow-men refuse to accept, all at once, a truth which appears self-evident to him. 
13	Lit., "you create a lie".
14	This passage - consisting of verses {19-23} - is parenthetically placed in the midst of the story of Abraham, connecting with the latter's reference to resurrection at the end of verse {17} ("unto Him you shall be brought back"). The ever-recurring emergence, decay and re-emergence of life, so vividly exemplified in all organic nature, is often cited in the Qur'an not merely in support of the doctrine of resurrection, but also as evidence of a consciously-devised plan underlying creation as such - and, thus, of the existence of the Creator.
15	Cf., for example, {23:12-14}, which alludes to man's coming into existence out of most primitive elements, and gradually evolving into a highly complex being endowed not only with a physical body but also with a mind, with feelings, and instincts.
16	Implying that such people deprive themselves of God's grace and mercy (which is the twofold significance of the term rahmah in this context) by rejecting all belief in His existence: in other words, belief in God - or one's readiness to believe in Him - is, in and by itself, already an outcome of His grace and mercy, just as suffering in the hereafter is an outcome of one's being "bent on denying the truth". 
17	Lit., "the answer of his people was nothing but that they said" - thus connecting with the passage ending with verse {18}.
18	See note [64] on {21:69}.
19	Lit., "solely out of love".
20	Thus Razi, explaining this idol-worship as a result of a mere blind imitation (taqlid) of attitudes inherited from past generations.
21	For an explanation of the concept of hijrah and of my above rendering of the term muhajir, see surah {2}, note [203], and surah {4}, note [124]. In the present instance this term is obviously used in both its physical and spiritual senses, analogous to the earlier allusion (in {19:48-49}) to Abraham's "withdrawal" (i'tizal) from his evil, native environment and to his physical migration to Harran (in northern Mesopotamia), and thence to Syria and Palestine. The story of Lot (Lut) is mentioned in the Qur'an several times, and particularly in {11:69-83}.
22	I.e., in addition to Ishmael (Isma'il), who had been born some years earlier (cf. {21:72}).
23	Among other things, by making him "a leader of men" ({2:124}).
24	This particular interpretation of the phrase taqta'un as-sabil is advanced by Baghawi and (on the authority of Al-Hassan) by Zamakhshari; Razi adopts it exclusively and without reservation.  
25	See {11:69} ff., as well as the first half of the corresponding note [99].
26	The term qaryah has here, as so often in classical Arabic, the connotation of "land", in this instance comprising the towns of Sodom and Gomorrah.
27	See note [66] on {7:83} and note [113] on {11:81}. In the present instance, as well as in the next verse, the past-tense auxiliary verb kanat is meant to stress the inevitability of the future event referred to; hence, "she will indeed be...", etc.
28	See note [107] on {11:77}.
29	This is an allusion to the Dead Sea - known to this day as Bahr Lut ("The Sea of Lot") - which covers most of the region in which Sodom and Gomorrah were once situated. Its waters contain so high a percentage of sulphur and potash that no fish or plants can live in them.
30	See note [67] on {7:85}. The story of Shuayb and his people appears in greater detail in {11:84-95}.
31	See note [62] on {7:78} (a passage which relates to the tribe of Thamud), and note [73] on {7:91}.
32	See surah {7}, second half of note [48], and note [56].
33	As regards the tribe of 'Ad, the above seems to be an allusion to their one-time capital, the legendary "Iram the many-pillared" (mentioned in the Qur'an only once, namely, in {89:7}). It has since been buried by the moving sand-dunes of Al-Ahqaf (a region between Uman and Hadramawt, within the great South-Arabian desert of Rub' al-Khali); it is said, however, that its traces are occasionally uncovered by strong winds. For an explanation of the reference to the dwellings of the Thamud, see note [59] on {7:74}.
34	Thus, the Qur'an implies that it is man's "ability to perceive the truth" (istibsar) that makes him morally responsible for his doings and, hence, for his failure to resist his own evil impulses - which is evidently the meaning of "Satan" in this context. See in this connection {14:22} and the corresponding notes [31] and [33].
35	As regards Qarun, see {28:76} ff. and, in particular, the corresponding note [84]; for Haman, note [6] on {28:6}. The common denominator between these two and Pharaoh is their false pride (takabbur) and arrogance (istikbar), which cause them to become "archetypes of evil" (cf. {28:41} and the corresponding note [40]). A similar attitude of mind is said to have been characteristic of the tribes of 'Ad and Thamud, mentioned in the preceding verse.
36	Sc., "of God's punishment": cf. note [98] on {11:67}.
37	Lit., "whatever thing they invoke instead of Him": i.e., He knows the nothingness of those false objects of worship (Zamakhshari), irrespective of whether they be imaginary deities, or deified saints, or forces of nature, or even false concepts or ideas; but He also knows the weakness of the human heart and mind and, hence, the hidden motivation of all such irrational worship.
38	Inasmuch as awareness of the existence of God is here postulated as a prerequisite of a full understanding of the Qur'anic parables (and, by implication, allegories as well), the above verse should be read side by side with the statement that the Qur'an is meant to be "a guidance for all the God-conscious, who believe in [the existence of] a reality which is beyond the reach of human perception" (see {2:2-3} and the corresponding note [3]). 
39	I.e., endowed with meaning and purpose: see surah {10}, note [11]. In other words, belief in the existence of a meaning and a purpose underlying the creation of the universe is a logical corollary of one's belief in God.
40	If we assume that verses {45-46} are addressed not merely to the Prophet but to believers in general (an assumption which is strengthened by the plural form of address in the last clause of verse {45} and throughout verse {46}), the above phrase may be taken to mean "whatever of the divine writ has revealed itself to thy understanding".
41	For an explanation of this rendering of the term and concept of al-munkar, see surah {16}, note [109].
42	Sc., "and are therefore not accessible to friendly argument": the implication being that in such cases all disputes should a priori be avoided. As regards religious discussions in general, see note [149] on {16:125}.
43	I.e., "in this spirit": a reference to the sameness of the fundamental truths in all revealed religions.
44	I.e., "they to whom We grant the ability to understand this divine writ".
45	This rendering of the verb jahada - in the present instance and in verse {49} below (as well as in {31:32}, {40:63} or {41:28}) - in the sense of a person's denying or rejecting something which he knows to be true is based on the authority of Zamakhshari's Asas. 
46	Lit., "with thy right hand" - the term yamin being used here metonymically, denoting no more than one's "own hand". - It is historically established that Muhammad, the "unlettered prophet" (cf. {7:157} and {158}), could neither read nor write, and could not, therefore, have derived his extensive knowledge of the contents of earlier revelations from the Bible or other scriptures: which - as the Qur'an points out - ought to convince any unprejudiced person that this knowledge must have come to him through divine revelation.
47	The participial noun mubtil is derived from the verb abtala, "he made a false [or  "vain"] claim", or "tried to disprove the truth [of something]", or "to reduce [something] to nothing", or "to prove [it] to be of no account", or "null and void", or "unfounded", "false", "spurious", etc., irrespective of whether the object is true or false, authentic or spurious, valid or unfounded (Lisan al-'Arab and Taj al-'Arus).
48	Lit., "self-evident (bayyinat) in the breasts of those who have been given knowledge" - the term 'ilm having here the connotation of intuitive, spiritual perception.
49	See note [94] on {6:109}.
50	I.e., "are the contents of this revelation not enough for them to make them grasp its intrinsic truth without the help of 'miraculous proofs' of its divine origin?" (Cf. note [60] on the last sentence of {7:75}.)
51	See note [32] on {8:32}.
52	I.e., from all directions and from many causes.
53	Implying that since the earth offers innumerable, multiform facilities to human life, there is no excuse for forgetting God "owing to the pressure of adverse circumstances". Whenever or wherever the worship of God - in its essential, and not merely liturgical sense - becomes impossible, the believer is obliged to "forsake the domain of evil" (which, as explained in note [124] on {4:97}, is the innermost meaning of the concept of hijrah) and to "migrate unto God", that is, to a place where it is possible to live in accordance with one's faith.
54	Lit., "that does not bear [or "assume responsibility for"] its sustenance" - i.e., is either too weak to fend for itself or (according to Al-Hasan, as quoted by Zamakhshari) does not store up provisions for the morrow. This passage connects with the reference at the end of the preceding verse to "those who in their Sustainer place their trust".
55	Regarding my rendering of la'in as "thus it is: if...", etc., see surah {30}, note [45]. The people spoken of in the sequence are such as do acknowledge the existence of God but have only a vague idea as to what this acknowledgment implies or should imply.
56	See surah {5}, note [90] The perversion consists in their thinking that they really "believe in God" and nevertheless worshipping false values and allegedly "divine" powers side by side with Him: all of which amounts to a virtual denial of His almightiness and uniqueness.
57	Sc., "and, hence, knows what is really good and, from the viewpoint of His unfathomable plan, necessary for each living being".
58	The particle li prefixed to the subsequent verbs yakfuru ("they show [utter] ingratitude") and yatamatta'u ("they enjoy [or "go on enjoying"] their worldly life") is not an indication of intent ("so that" or "in order that") but merely of a causal sequence; in the above context, it may be appropriately rendered as "and thus".
59	See note [58] on the second paragraph of {28:57}. In contrast to the "sanctuary secure" - the inner peace and sense of spiritual fulfilment which God bestows on those who truly believe in Him - the atheist or agnostic is more often than not exposed to fear of the Unknown and a despair born of the uncertainty as to what will happen to him after death.
60	I.e., by persuading himself that there is, side by side with God or even independently of Him, any "power" that could govern men's destinies.
61	Lit., "Our paths". The plural used here is obviously meant to stress the fact - alluded to often in the Qur'an - that there are many paths which lead to a cognizance (ma'rifah) of God.
