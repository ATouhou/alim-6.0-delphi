THE SIXTY-THIRD SURAH
AL-MUNAFIQUN (THE HYPOCRITES)

1	See note [26] on the identical sentence in {58:16}.
2	The particle thumma ("and then") has often the same function as the simple conjunctive wa ("and"), which in this case may be properly rendered as "whereas".
3	See surah {2}, note [7].
4	Lit., "thou dost give ear to them": i.e., hypocrisy has usually a plausible outward aspect inasmuch as it is meant to deceive.
5	Regarding my interpolation of the phrase "They deserve the imprecation", see note [45] on the identical sentence at the end of {9:30}.
6	See surah {5}, note [90].
7	Cf. {9:80} and the corresponding note [111].
8	I.e., to the people of Medina in general, and to the ansar in particular (see next note).
9	The leader of the hypocrites of Medina, 'Abd Allah ibn Ubayy, never forgave the Prophet for having overshadowed him who previously had been unquestioningly recognized by the people of Medina as their most outstanding leader. Since the Prophet's political strength depended mainly on the Meccan Muslims who followed him in his hijrah to Medina, Ibn Ubayy tried to persuade his compatriots - many of whom were supporting the newcomers with all the means at their disposal - to withdraw this material support and thereby force the muhajirun, most of whom were very poor, to leave Medina: a stratagem which, if successful, would have greatly weakened the Prophet's position. This suggestion of the leader of the hypocrites was, of course, rejected by the ansar.
10	I.e., Medina, the "City of the Prophet" (Madinat an-Nabi), as the town previously called Yathrib began to be known after the hijrah. Since - as it is established through several ahadith - the subsequent saying was uttered by 'Abd Allah ibn Ubayy during the campaign against the tribe of Banu Mustaliq in 5 H., it is obvious that verses {7} and {8} were revealed at the same date or a little later.
11	It is in these two Qur'anic statements - "unto God belong the treasures...", etc., and "all honour belongs to God...", etc. - that the real, lasting purport of the above historical allusions is to be found.
12	See surah {2}, note [4].
13	Lit., "for (ila) a term close by".
