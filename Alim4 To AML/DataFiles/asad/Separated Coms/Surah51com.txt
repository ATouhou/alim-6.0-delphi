THE FIFTY-FIRST SURAH
ADH-DHARIYAT (THE DUST-SCATTERING WINDS)
MECCA PERIOD

1	These symbolical epithets, consisting of adjectival participles without any mention of the nouns which they qualify, have been variously interpreted by the early commentators; but since there is a consensus of opinion regarding the first of these participles - adh-dhariyat - as denoting "dust-scattering winds", we may assume that the other three relate to different phases or manifestations of the same phenomenon (Razi) - namely, to the life-giving function of the combination of wind, clouds and rain - pointing, symbolically, to the miraculous creation of life as such and, thus, to the existence of a conscious, purposeful Creator.
2	I.e., life after death.
3	I.e., "think of the Creator of this great universe and, hence, of your responsibility to Him".
4	Lit., "you are indeed in a discordant opinion (qawl)", i.e., as to whether or not there is life after death, whether God exists, whether there is any truth in divine revelation, and so forth.
5	Lit., "perversely turned away from this [truth] is he who is made to lie" - or, according to the Taj al-'Arus, "he who is perverted in his reason and opinion", i.e., who is a priori disposed to deceive himself: implying that belief in God and, hence, in life after death is inherent in man's mind and feeling, and that, therefore, a departure from this belief is but an outcome of intellectual perversion.
6	For this rendering of the expression qutila, see note [9] on {74:19}.
7	Thus the Taj al-'Arus, explaining the deeper meaning of al-kharrasun. "That which they cannot ascertain" is, in this context, synonymous with al-ghayb, "the reality which is beyond the reach of human perception".
8	This "trial (fitnah) by the fire" is in tune with several Qur'anic allusions to the effect that the otherworldly suffering described as "hell" is not to be eternal: see in this connection note [114] on {6:128}, note [10] on {40:12} and note [53] on {43:74}.
9	A reference to their one-time sarcastic demand that they should be punished for their rejection of the Qur'anic message: cf. {6:57-58} and {8:32}.
10	Lit., "before that [Day]".
11	See note [10] on {3:17}.
12	Sc., "but could not beg" - and this applies to all living creatures, whether human beings or mute animals (Razi), irrespective of whether the need is of a physical or an emotional nature.
13	See note [3] on {45:4}.
14	I.e., both physical (rain) and spiritual (truth and guidance).
15	Lit., "even as you speak" or "are able to speak": an allusion to man's ability to think conceptually and to express himself - that is, to something of which man is absolutely, axiomatically conscious.
16	This story (as well as the subsequent mention of what happened to Lot's people and to the tribes of 'Ad and Thamud, of Moses and Pharaoh's people, and of Noah's people) is connected with the preceding references to the "signs", visible and conceptual, of God's existence and almightiness and the inflexible moral causality apparent in what the Qur'an describes as "the way of God" (sunnat Allah). The story of Abraham's angelic guests appears also in {11:69} ff. and - in a somewhat shorter version - in {15:51} ff. as well.
17	Lit., "unknown people' - i.e., not realizing that they were angels.
18	See note [101] on {11:70}.
19	I.e., with prophethood (cf. {15:53}).
20	I.e., Lot's people.
21	Lit., "stones of clay" - the noun "clay" (tin) is, according to Zamakhshari, identical with the term sijjil mentioned in {11:82} and tentatively explained in the corresponding note [114] as signifiying "chastisement pre-ordained".
22	For an explanation of this rendering of the term musrifin, see note [21] on {10:12}.
23	Lit., "And then", i.e., after the events described in {11:77} ff. and {15:61} ff.
24	I.e., Lot's family.
25	I.e., in the utter destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah.
26	The above interpolations are based on the consensus of most of the classical commentators regarding the phrase "And in Moses, too".
27	This is an illustration of the Qur'anic doctrine that the suffering which is bound to befall an evildoer in this world or in the life to come, or in both, is but a consequence of his own doings.
28	See {69:6-8}. For the story of the tribe of 'Ad as such, see second half of note [48] on {7:65}.
29	Cf. {11:65}. An outline of the story of the Thamud is given in {7:73-79}.
30	Lit., "the sky" or "the heaven", which in the Qur'an often has the connotation of "universe" or, in the plural ("the heavens"), of "cosmic systems".
31	See note [38] on the first part of {21:30}. The phrase inna la-musi'un clearly foreshadows the modern notion of the "expanding universe" - that is, the fact that the cosmos, though finite in extent, is continuously expanding in space.
32	I.e., in accordance with the requirements of the living organisms that were to - and did - develop on it.
33	Lit., "of every thing have We created pairs" - a phrase which is explained in note [18] on {36:36}.
34	Cf. {89:3} and the corresponding note [2].
35	Lit., "do not set up any other deity".
36	Lit., "sorcerer".
37	For a full discussion of the term jinn ("invisible beings"), see Appendix III. As pointed out by most of the philologists - and stressed by Razi in his comments on the above verse - this term includes also the angels, since they, too, are beings or forces "concealed from man's senses".
38	Thus, the innermost purpose of the creation of all rational beings is their cognition (ma'rifah) of the existence of God and, hence, their conscious willingness to conform their own existence to whatever they may perceive of His will and plan: and it is this twofold concept of cognition and willingness that gives the deepest meaning to what the Qur'an describes as "worship" ('ibadah). As the next verse shows, this spiritual call does not arise from any supposed "need" on the part of the Creator, who is self-sufficient and infinite in His power, but is designed as an instrument for the inner development of the worshipper, who, by the act of his conscious self-surrender to the all-pervading Creative Will, may hope to come closer to an understanding of that Will and, thus, closer to God Himself.
39	Implying that every act of evildoing bears the seed of its own retribution either in this world or in the hereafter.
