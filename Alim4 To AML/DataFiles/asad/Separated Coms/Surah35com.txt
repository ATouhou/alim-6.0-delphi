SURAH 35
AL-FATIR

1	The "wings" of the spiritual beings or forces comprised within the designation of angels are, obviously, a metaphor for the speed and power with which God's revelations are conveyed to His prophets. Their multiplicity ("two, or three, or four") is perhaps meant to stress the countless ways in which He causes His commands to materialize within the universe created by Him: an assumption which, to my mind, is supported by an authentic hadith to the effect that on the night of his Ascension (see Appendix IV) the Prophet saw Gabriel "endowed with six hundred wings" (Bukhari and Muslim, on the authority of Ibn Mas'ud).
2	I.e., the process of creation is continuous, constantly expanding in scope, range and variety.
3	See {10:31} and the corresponding note [49].
4	Sc., "inasmuch as you attribute divine qualities or powers to anyone or anything beside Him". For an explanation of the phrase anna tu'fakun (lit., "how turned-away you are", i.e., from the truth), see surah {5}, note [90].
5	See {31:33} (which is phrased in exactly the same way) and the corresponding note [30]. - As regards the explicit reference to Satan in the next verse of the present surah, see Razi's remarks quoted in note [31] on {14:22}, as well as note [16] on {15:17}.
6	See surah {14}, note [4], which explains my rendering of this sentence.
7	It appears that in this context - as in the first paragraph of {10:21} or in {34:33} - both the noun makr (lit., "a scheme", or "scheming" or "plotting") and the verb yamkurun (lit., "they scheme" or "plot") have the connotation of "devising false [or "fallacious"] arguments" against something that is true. Since the preceding passages refer to God's creativeness and, in particular, to His power to create life and resurrect the dead (verse {9}), the "evil deeds" spoken of above are, presumably, specious arguments meant to "disprove" the announcement of resurrection.
8	See second half of note [47] on {3:59}, and note [4] on {23:12}.
9	Lit., "makes you pairs" or "mates" [of one another].
10	This interpolated sentence reflects Razi's convincing explanation of the passage that follows here, and its connection with the preceding one.
11	For this rendering of al-bahran, see note [41] on {25:53}.
12	See surah {13}, note [5].
13	The Qur'an states in many places that all false objects of worship - whether saints, angels, relics, fetishes, or deified forces of nature - will bear witness against their one-time worshippers on Resurrection Day, and will "disown" them: a symbolic allusion to man's perception, at the end of time, of the ultimate reality.
14	See note [27] on {14:19}.
15	I.e., on Judgment Day - for "whatever [wrong] any human being commits rests upon him alone" ({6:164}, which is followed by a sentence identical with the one above).
16	Thus, any transfer of moral responsibility from one person to another is shown to be impossible. Whereas the first part of the above statement implies a negation of the Christian doctrine of "original sin" with which mankind is supposedly burdened, the second part categorically refutes the doctrine of the "vicarious atonement" of that sin by Jesus. (See also {53:38} and the corresponding note [31].)
17	For an explanation of this rendering of bi'l-ghayb, see surah {2}, note [3]. The meaning is that only those "who believe in the existence of that which is beyond the reach of human perception" can really benefit by the "warning" inherent in the preceding statement. (See also {27:8-81} and {30:52-53}.)
18	One of the meanings of the term ummah (preferred by Zamakhshari in his commentary on the above verse) is "people of one time" or "age"; another, "people of one kind", i.e., "a nation" or "a community" (which is adopted by me in this context). Taking into consideration a third, well-established meaning, namely, "a [particular] way of life" or "of behaviour" (Jawhari), the term "community" comes, in this instance, close to the modern concept of "civilization" in its historical sense. - The stress on the warners' (i.e., prophets) having "passed away" is meant to emnhasize the humanness and mortality of each and all of them.
19	Cf. {16:13}, where the splendour of nature ("the beauty of many hues") is spoken of as an evidence of God's creative power.
20	I.e., spiritual knowledge, born of the realization that the phenomena which can be observed do not comprise the whole of reality, inasmuch as there is "a realm beyond the reach of a created being's perception" (cf. surah {2}, note [3]).
21	For this explanatory rendering of the phrase ma bayna yodayhi, see note [3] on {3:3}.
22	See {7:46} and the corresponding note [37].
23	Regarding this symbolic "adornment" of the blessed in paradise, see note [41] on {18:31}.
24	See note [22] on {2:30}. In this instance, God s having made man "inherit the earth" implies the grant to him of the ability to discern between right and wrong as well as between truth and falsehood.
25	Lit., "those [God-]partners of yours": see note [15] on {6:22}.
26	I.e., to those who ascribe divinity to beings or forces other than God.
27	Cf. {30:35} - "Have We ever bestowed upon them from on high a divine writ which would speak [with approval] of their worshipping aught beside Us?" The reference to a "divine writ" makes it clear that the people spoken of here are the erring followers of earlier revelation, and not atheists.
28	I.e., their expectation that the saints whom they invest with divine or semi-divine qualities will "mediate" between them and God, or "intercede" for them before Him, is based on nothing but wishful thinking.
29	Lit., "the heavens" - in this case apparently a metonym for all the stars, galaxies, nebulae, etc., which traverse the cosmic spaces in obedience to a most intricate system of God-willed laws, of which the law of gravity, perhaps most obvious to man, is but one.
30	Lit., "after Him". This seems to be an allusion to the Last Hour, which, according to the Qur'an, will be heralded by a cosmic catastrophe.
31	I.e., inasmuch as He does not speed up the end of the world despite the sinfulness of most of its inhabitants, and neither punishes without giving the sinner time to reflect and to repent (cf. verse {45}).
32	Cf. {6:157} and the corresponding note [158].
33	I.e., fallacious arguments meant to disparage those messages and to "disprove" their divine origin (cf. {10:21} or {34:33} and the corresponding notes on the Qur'anic use of the term makr in this sense).
34	I.e., the way (sunnah) in which God has punished them.
35	Or: "known [to Him alone]" - i.e., the end of their lives on earth.
