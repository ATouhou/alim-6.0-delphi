THE SIXTY-FIFTH SURAH
AT-TALAQ (DIVORCE)


1	The plural "you" indicates that the whole community is thus addressed.
2	See {2:228} and the corresponding notes, especially note [215]. - Most of the great jurists hold the view that the required three pronouncements of divorce, which make it final and irrevocable (cf. first paragraph of {2:229}, must be made singly, i.e., spaced over the waiting-period of three months, so as to give the husband time to reconsider his intention, and thus to prevent a hasty act which might be subsequently regretted. This provision is in tune with the well-authenticated saying of the Prophet, "In the sight of God, the most hateful of all things allowed (abghad al-halali) is divorce" (Abu Da'ud, on the authority of 'Abd Allah ibn 'Umar). In other words, divorce is just barely permissible, and must not be resorted to unless it is absolutely evident that nothing can save the marriage from utter hopelessness.
3	I.e. during the waiting-period. As shown in verse {6} below, during that period the husband is fully responsible for the maintenance of the wife whom he is divorcing in accordance with the standard of living observed during their married life.
4	E.g., by their husbands' failure to provide for their maintenance. (This particular injunction does not imply a prohibition of a divorced woman's leaving her home of her own free will.)
5	Implying that in such a case she may be lawfully turned out of her marital home. Regarding the term fahishah ("immoral conduct"), see surah {4}, note [14].
6	According to Ibn 'Abbas (as quoted by Razi) and several other authorities (see Ibn Kathir), this is an allusion to the possibility of reconciliation and, hence, a resumption of marital relations before the divorce becomes final (see surah {2}, second part of verse {228} and first paragraph of {229}).
7	Lit., "from yourselves": i.e., persons who are sufficiently acquainted with the circumstances of the case.
8	Sc., that the relevant decision has not been made in a frivolous spirit.
9	Lit., "whence he does not expect". It is to be noted that the relative pronoun man ("whoever" or "everyone who") - although grammatically requiring the use of the masculine gender in the verbs or pronouns to which it relates - applies to persons of either sex, as is evidenced by innumerable passages in the Qur'an: hence, the present passage, too, including the sentence that follows, must be understood as relating to the women as well as to the men in question; and the same holds good of verses {5} and {11} below.
10	I.e., for any physiological reason whatever.
11	Lit., "He grants ease out of his condition" - i.e., makes his condition easy: the implication being that God-consciousness makes it easy for the believer to submit gladly to whatever God may decree.
12	Lit., "let them dwell wherever you dwell" - i.e., tropically, "let them share fully your standard of living".
13	E.g., for reasons of her health, or because she intends to remarry, etc.
14	I.e., at the father's expense: see {2:233} and the corresponding notes [219] and [220].
15	Lit., "out of".
16	This connects with, and stresses, the fact that all the preceding injunctions are divinely ordained.
17	See note [4] on {64:5}.
18	See surah {2}, note [20].
19	Lit., "the command". The verbal form yatanazzalu implies recurrence and continuity; its combination with the noun al-amr reflects the concept of God's unceasing creative activity.
