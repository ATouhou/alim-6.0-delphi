THE HUNDRED-FIRST SURAH
AL-QARI'AH (THE SUDDEN CALAMITY)

1	I.e., the coming of the Last Hour, which will involve a terrifying transformation of the world (see note [63] on {14:48} and note [90] on {20:105-107}).
2	Lit., "his mother [i.e., goal] will be an abyss", sc., of suffering and despair. The term "mother" (umm) is used idiomatically to denote something that embraces or enfolds.
3	Lit., "hot fire", the adjective meant to stress the essential quality of fire. It should be borne in mind that all Qur'anic descriptions of the sinner's suffering in the hereafter are metaphors or allegories relating to situations and conditions which can be understood only by means of comparisons with physical phenomena lying within the range of human experience (see Appendix I).
