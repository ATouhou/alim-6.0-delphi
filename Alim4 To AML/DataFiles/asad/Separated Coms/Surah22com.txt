THE TWENTY-SECOND SURAH
THE PILGRIMAGE

1	Lit., “thou shalt see [or “behold”] mankind drunk”, i.e., behaving as if they were drunk. The illusory, purely subjective character of this “seeing” — implied in the use of the singular form tara (“thou shalt see”) after the plural “you” employed in the first clause of this verse — justifies the rendering “it will seem to thee that...“, etc.
2	My interpolation of the words “their dread of” is based on the statement in {21:103} that, as far as the righteous are concerned, “the supreme awesomeness [of the Day of Resurrection] will cause them no grief” despite the dread with which it will overwhelm every human being.
3	See first half of note [16] on {15:17}.
4	This rendering conforms with the interpretation of the phrase mukhallaqah wa-ghayr mukhallaqah by Ibn 'Abbas and Qatadah (the latter quoted by Tabari and the former by Baghawi), alluding to the various stages of embryonic development. In addition, Tabari explains the expression ghayr mukhallaqa as denoting the stage at which the embryonic lump (mudghah) has as yet no individual life - or, in his words, "when no soul has as yet been breathed into it" (la yunfakh fiha ar-ruh). - As regards the expression "created out of dust", it is meant to indicate man's lowly biological origin and his affinity with other "earthy" substances; see in this connection the second half of note [47] on {3:59}, and note [4] on {23:12}.
5	See note [79] on {16:70}.
6	See surah {20}, note [99].
7	Since many unrighteous people apparently "prosper" in this world, it is clear that the disgrace of which the above verse speaks is of a moral nature - namely, a gradual coarsening of all moral perceptions and. thus. a degradation of the spirit. 
8	I.e., wavering between belief and disbelief, and not really committed to either.
9	Lit., “he turns about on his face” — the “face” (wajh) of man signifying metonymically his whole being.
10	Lit., “the [most] obvious loss”.
11	By failing to commit himself unreservedly to the faith which he professes, man is often inclined to attribute to all manner of extraneous forces, be they real or imaginary, a decisive “influence” on his own destiny, and thus invests them, as it were, with divine qualities.
12	Lit., “this, this (dhalika huwa) is the straying far-away”. For an explanation of my paraphrase, see note [25] on the last sentence of {14:18}.
13	The interpolation of “another human being” in the opening clause of this verse is necessitated by the relative pronoun man (“one that” or “who”), which almost always relates to an animate person — in this case, a human being who, by allowing himself to be idolized by those who “worship God on the border-line of faith”, causes infinite spiritual harm to himself and to his followers.
14	I.e., that God is not enough to succour him: obviously an allusion to the type of man who “worships God on the border-line of faith” (verse {11} above) and therefore doubts His power to guide men towards happiness in this world and in the hereafter. The assumption of the majority of the commentators that the personal pronoun “him” relates to the Prophet Muhammad is, to my mind, very far-fetched and certainly not warranted by the context.
15	The rendering of la-yaqta' as “let him [try to] make headway” is based on the accepted, tropical use of the verb qata'a (lit., “he cut”) in the sense of “traversing a distance”: and this is the interpretation of yaqtac by Abu Muslim (as quoted by Razi). The expression “by any [other] means” (bi-sabab) relates to what has been said in verses {12—13} above.
16	Lit., “that which causes anger” or “exasperation”, i.e., anguish at finding himself helpless and abandoned.
17	Or: "God guides aright whomever He wills". For an explanation of the rendering adopted by me, see note [4] on {14:4}.
18	See surah [2]. note {49}.
19	Al-majus: the followers of Zoroaster or Zarathustra (Zardusht), the Iranian prophet who lived about the middle of the last millenium B.C. and whose teachings are laid down in the Zend-Avesta. They are represented today by the Gabrs of Iran and, more prominently, by the Parsis of India and Pakistan. Their religion. though dualistic in philosophy, is based on belief in God as the Creator of the universe.
20	The Christians and the Magians (Zoroastrians) are included in the first category, for although they do ascribe divine qualities to other beings beside God, they regard those beings, fundamentally, as no more than manifestations - or incarnations - of the One God, thus persuading themselves that they are worshipping Him alone; whereas "those who are bent on ascribing divinity to beings other than God" (alladhina ashraku) by obvious implication reject the principle of His oneness and uniqueness.
21	For the meaning of this "prostration", see {13:15} and {16:48-49}, and the corresponding notes. My rendering of the relative pronoun man, in this context, as "all [things and beingsl that..." is explained in note [33] on {13:15}.
22	According to Zamakhshari and Razi, this interpolated phrase - with its stress on "consciously"-is an elliptically implied predicate (khabar) linked with the preceding nominal subject (mabtada'): the purport being that although everything in creation "prostrates itself" before God, willingly or unwillingly (cf. {13:15}), not all human beings do so consciously.
23	Lit., "whereas upon many a one the suffering [in the li75 This is apparently an allusion to the fleets of sailing ships which brought untold riches to Palestine ("the land which We had blessed") and made Solomon's wealth proverbial.
24	Lit., "these two adversaries" or "antagonists", i.e., those who believe in God's oneness and uniqueness, and those who ascribe divine qualities to beings other than Him, or even deny His existence altogether.
25	I.e., in distinction from those who err out of ignorance.
26	For this rendering of hamim, see note [62] on the concluding sentence of {6:70}, as well as note [65] on {14:50} and note [7] on {73:12—13}, which mention Razi’s interpretations of similar allegorical descriptions of the suffering that will befall the sinners in the hereafter.
27	I.e., causing their inner and outer personality utterly to disintegrate.
28	Lit., “for them will be grips (maqami) of iron”. The noun miqma'ah — of which maqami is the plural — is derived from the verb qama'a, signifying “he curbed” or “restrained” or “held in subjection” (Lisan al-'Arab). Hence, the “iron grips” mentioned in the above verse denote the inescapability of the suffering in the hereafter to which “they who are bent on denying the truth” condemn themselves.
29	See {18:31} and the corresponding note [41].
30	I.e., that there is no deity save God. (One must bear in mind that the term qawl denotes not merely a saying but also an intellectually formulated “opinion” or “tenet”.)
31	This connects with the allusion, in the preceding verse, to “the way that leads to the One unto whom all praise is due”.
32	Lit., “who aim therein at a deviation from the right course (ilhad)” — a term which circumscribes every perversion of religious tenets.
33	According to Ibn 'Abbas as quoted by Ibn Hisham, this verse was revealed towards the end of the year 6 H., when the pagan Quraysh refused the Prophet and his followers, who had come on pilgrimage from Medina, the right of entry into Mecca, and thus into the sanctuary of the Ka'bah (the “Inviolable House of Worship”). But whether or not this claim is correct — and we have no definite historical evidence in either sense — the purport of the above verse is not restricted to any historical situation but relates to every attempt at preventing believers, be it physically or through intellectual seduction, from going on pilgrimage to this symbolic centre of their faith, or at destroying its sanctity in their eyes.
34	I.e., the Ka'bah: see note [102] on {2:125}.
35	In view of the oft-repeated Qur'anic statement that Abraham was beyond all temptation to ascribe divinity to anything but God, it seems to me that the above injunction has a specific import, namely, "Do not allow this Temple to become an object of worship, but make it clear that it is holy only by virtue of its being the first temple ever dedicated to the worship of the One God" (cf. {3:96}). Apart from that, it refers to "those who are bent on denying the truth" spoken of at the beginning of the preceding verse.
36	See surah {2}, note [104].
37	Lit., "proclaim thou the pilgrimage among the people", i.e., the believers (Tabari). Most of the commentators assume that this passage is a continuation of God's command to Abraham; but some of them - in particular, Al-Hasan al-Basri - consider it to have been addressed to the Prophet Muhammad. (Regarding the annual pilgrimage to Mecca, as instituted in Islam, see {2:196-203} and the corresponding notes.)
38	Lit., "lean mount" - an expression which has induced some of the commentators to assume that it denotes "a camel that has become lean on account of a long and fatiguing journey". However, the verb dammarahu or admarahu relates in classical Arabic not only to camels but also to horses, and has the meaning of "he made it [i.e., the mount] lean and fit [for racing or warl"; thus, the noun midmar signifies "a training-ground where horses are prepared for racing or war", as well as "a race-course" (Jawhari, Asas, etc.; cf. also Lane V, 1803 f.). Hence, the adjectival noun damir - especially when contrasted, as above, with the expression rijalan ("on foot") - has the connotation of "fleetness" or more properly, "fitness for speed", and may by inference be applied to every kind of "fast conveyance".
39	Lit., "that they might witness benefits [accruing] to them" - i.e., increased consciousness of God through facing the first temple ever dedicated to Him, as well as the consciousness of being part of a brotherhood embracing all believers. Apart from these spiritual benefits, the annual pilgrimage to Mecca provides an opportunity for believers from all parts of the world to become acquainted with the many social and political problems that confront various geographically separated sectors of the community.
40	The repeated Qur'anic insistence on pronouncing the name of God whenever one slaughters an animal is meant to make the believers "realize the awfulness of taking life, and the solemn nature of the trust which God has conferred upon them in the permission to eat the flesh of animals" (Marmaduke Pickthall, The Meaning of the Glorious Koran, London 1930, p. 342, footnote 2). As regards the "days appointed" (ayyam ma 'lumat) spoken of above, they apparently denote the Festival of Sacrifices, which falls on the 10th of the lunar month of Dhu 'l-Hijjah, as well as the nest two days, marking the end of the pilgramage (Ibn 'Abbas, as quoted by Razi).
41	Whereas the pilgrims are merely permitted to eat some of the flesh of the animals which they have sacrificed, the feeding of the poor is mandatory (Tabari and Zamakhshari) and constitutes, thus, the primary objective of these sacrifices. Apart from this, they are meant to commemorate Abraham’s readiness to sacrifice his first-born son after he dreamt that God demanded of him this supreme sacrifice (see {37:102—107} and the corresponding notes); furthermore, they are a reminder that God is the Provider of all sustenance and the One who gives life and deals death, and that all must return to Him; and, lastly (as stressed by Razi), they are to be symbols of each believer’s readiness to sacrifice himself in the cause of truth.
42	In Tabari’s opinion, the phrase thumma ‘l-yaqda tafathahum signifies “then let them complete the acts of worship (manasik) incumbent on them by virtue of their pilgrimage”. Other commentators, however, understand by the (extremely rare) expression tafath the prohibition of enjoying, while in the actual state of pilgrimage, certain bodily comforts like cutting or shaving one’s hair (see {2:196}), wearing any clothing but the simple, unsewn pilgrim’s garb (ihram), indulging in sexual intercourse ({2:197}), etc. Consequently, they explain the above phrase as meaning “let them bring to an end the [condition of self-denial described as] tafath which was incumbent on them during pilgrimage”.
43	I.e., around the Kaabah (see surah {2}, notes [102] and [104]), thus completing the pilgrimage.
44	See the first paragraph of {5:3}. Once again, the Qur’an stresses the principle that everything that has not been explicitly forbidden is per se lawful.
45	The term awthan (lit., “idols”) denotes not merely actual, concrete images of false deities but also, in its widest sense, everything that is associated with false beliefs and practices or with a tendency to “worship” false values: hence the subsequent injunction to shun “every word that is untrue”.
46	For an explanation of the term hunafa’ (sing. hanif), see note [110] on {2:135}.
47	Lit., “God’s symbols (sha'a'ir)~~ — an expression which in this context refers to the rites of pilgrimage (see the second half of note [4] on {5:2}). This stress on the symbolic character of all the rites connected with the pilgrimage is meant to draw the believer’s attention to the spiritual meaning of those rites, and thus to warn him against making, unthinkingly, a sort of fetish of them. — The assumption of some of the commentators that the “symbols” referred to here relate specifically to the sacrificial animals, resp. their sacrifice as such, is not warranted by the text. As Tabari explains in his commentary on this and the next verse, the term sha'a’ir comprises all the rites, actions and places connected with the pilgrimage (all of which have a symbolic meaning), and cannot be restricted to any one of them.
48	I.e., “until the end of your lives” (Baydawi).
49	The noun mahill, derived from the verb halla (lit., "he untied" or "undid" [e.g., a knot]", or "he loosened [a load]", or "he alighted"), denotes primarily a "destination", as well as "the time or place at which an obligation [e.g., a debt] falls due" (Taj al-'Arus ). In the above context, in which this term obviously relates to the "God-consciousness" (taqwa) unequivocally mentioned in the preceding verse, it has the tropical meaning of "goal and end", implying that the realization of God's oneness and uniqueness - symbolized by the Ka'bah (the "Most Ancient Temple") - is the goal and end of all true God-consciousness.
50	I.e., as a conscious, selfless offering in His name of something that one cherishes as necessary and valuable, and not as an attempt to "propitiate" Him who is far above anything that resembles human emotion. (See also verse {36} below.)
51	See surah {2}, note [4].
52	See note [47] above.
53	Lit., "of them".
54	Lit., "thus".
55	I.e., the sacrificial animals.
56	See surah {4}, note [134].
57	Lit., “inasmuch as they have been wronged”. Connecting with the promise, in the preceding verse, that “God will ward off [all evil] from those who attain to faith”, the present verse enunciates the permission to fight physically in self-defence. All relevant Traditions (quoted, in particular, by Tabari and Ibn Kathir) show that this is the earliest Qur'anic reference to the problem of war as such. According to Abd Allah ibn 'Abbas, it was revealed immediately after the Prophet left Mecca for Medina, i.e., at the beginning of the year 1 H. The principle of war in self-defence — and only in self-defence — has been further elaborated in Al-Baqarah, which was revealed about a year later (see {2: 190—193} and the corresponding notes).
58	Lit., “were it not that God repels some people by means of others” (cf. the identical phrase in the second paragraph of {2: 251}).
59	The implication is that the defence of religious freedom is the foremost cause for which arms may — and, indeed, must — be taken up (see {2:193} and the corresponding note [170]), or else, as stressed in the concluding clause of {2:251}, “corruption would surely overwhelm the earth”.
60	I.e., not by his own people, since these, despite their sinning, had accepted him as God's prophet (Tabari). References to the tribes of 'Ad and Thamud and the people of Madyan are given in surah {7}, notes [48], [56] and [67].
61	Lit., "whereupon they would have hearts wherewith they might understand, or ears whereby they might hear".
62	For an explanation, see {6:57}, {8:32} and {13:6}, as well as the corresponding notes.
63	I.e., what men conceive of as "time" has no meaning with regard to God, because He is timeless, without beginning and without end, so that "in relation to Him, one day and a thousand years are alike" (Razi). Cf. {70:4}, where in the same sense, a "day" is said to be equal to "fifty thousand years", or the well-authenticated saying of the Prophet' "God says, 'I am Time Absolute (ad-dahr)'."
64	See {8:4} and the corresponding note [5].
65	Lit., "We never sent any apostle or prophet before thee without that, when he was hoping (tamanna)...", etc. According to most of the commentators, the designation "apostle" (rasul) is applied to bearers of divine revelations which comprise a new doctrinal system or dispensation; a "prophet" (nabi), on the other hand, is said to be one whom God has entrusted with the enunciation of ethical principles on the basis of an already-existing dispensation, or of principles common to all divine dispensations.  Hence, every apostle is a prophet as well, but not every prophet is an apostle.
66	I.e., insinuating that the innermost aim (umniyyah, lit., "longing" or "hope") of the message-bearer in question was not the spiritual improvement of his community but, rather, the attainment of personal power and influence: cf. {6:112}-"against every prophet We have set up as enemies the evil forces (shayatin) from among humans as well as from among invisible beings (al-jinn)" - a statement which is explained in surah {6}, note [98].
67	Lit., "and God makes His messages clear in and by themselves". This is the meaning of the phrase yuhkimu ayatahu (cf. the expression uhkimat ayatuhu in {11:1}): i.e., God causes His messages to speak for themselves, so that any insinuation as to the prophet's "hidden motives" is automatically disproved. The conjunction thumma at the beginning of this clause does not connote a sequence in time but a coordination of activities, and is best rendered by the simple conjunction "and".
68	See {2:10} and the corresponding note.
69	Lit., "all [such] evildoers".
70	Lit., "or [until] there comes upon them the chastisement [or "suffering] of a barren Day", i.e., the Day of Judgment, which will offer no hope to those who, until their death, failed to realize the existence of God or to submit to His guidance.
71	For this rendering of the phrase alladhina hajaru, see note [203] on {2:218}. The subsequent mention of "those who strive in God's cause, and then are slain or die" connects with the reference, in verses {39-40}, to God's permission to the believers to fight in defence of their faith and liberty. The extreme merit of the self-sacrifice involved is stressed in several Qur'anic passages, and particularly in {4:95-96}; hence, it has also a bearing on the Day of Judgement spoken of in the preceding passage.
72	Or: “cause them to enter [upon their life after death] in a manner that will please them well” (cf. note [40] on the last clause of {4:31}) — thus implying that by sacrificing their lives in God’s cause they will have obtained His forgiveness of whatever sins they may have previously committed.
73	Lit., "who has retaliated with the like of what he had been afflicted with" - i.e., has acted only in self-defence and done to his enemy no more than the enemy had done to him. (A similar phrase, relating to retaliation in argument, is found in {16:126} and explained in the corresponding note [150].)
74	While the opening sentence of this verse stresses the principle of self-defence as the only justification of war (cf. {2:190} and {192-193}) - with the proviso that retaliation must not exceed the injury initially suffered - the concluding part of the verse implies that in case of repeated, unprovoked aggression the believers are allowed to wage an all-out war with a view to destroying completely the enemy's military power. Since such an all-out war might seem to conflict with the principle of limited retaliation alluded to above, the Qur'an states that God absolves the believers of what otherwise might have been a sin, since it is they "against whom war is being wrongfully waged" (verse {39}) by repeated acts of aggression.
75	Sc., "and therefore has the power to succour the believers who have been wronged".
76	I.e., it is He who knows what is in the hearts of men, and nevertheless, in His unfathomable wisdom, allows the darkness of oppression to grow at the expense of the light of freedom, and then causes the light to overcome the darkness: an eternal, cyclical recurrence which dominates the life of mankind. (As Ibn Kathir points out, the above passage contains a direct allusion to {3:26-27}-"Say: O God, Lord of all dominion! Thou grantest dominion unto whom Thou willest, and takest away dominion from whom Thou willest.... Thou hast the power to will anything: Thou makest the night grow longer by shortening the day, and Thou makest the day grow longer by shortening the night...."
77	See surah {20}, note [99].
78	For an explanation of the term latif ("unfathomable"), see surah {6}, note [89].
79	I.e., "has enabled you to benefit from all. . .", etc. (cf. surah {14}, note [46]).
80	Lit., "the sky" - used here as a metonym for the stars and planets, which are held on their courses by the God-willed laws of cosmic movement (Maraghi XVII, 137).
81	I.e., at the Last Hour, which - as the Qur'an so often states - will manifest itself in universal cosmic catastrophe.
82	Lit., "a way of worship" (mansak, which sometimes denotes also "an act of worship"). For a fuller explanation of this passage, see the second paragraph of {5:48}-"Unto every one of you have We appointed a [different] law and way of life" - and the corresponding notes [66-68].
83	I.e., do not allow thyself to be drawn into disputes" (Zamakhshari and Baghawi).
84	Cf. {10:41} -"To me [shall be accounted] my doings, and to you, your doings: you are not accountable for what I am doing, and I am not accountable for whatever you do".
85	See surah {2}, note [94].
86	I.e., despite their awareness that God alone knows all and is, therefore, unique in His all-embracing Presence.
87	See surah {3}, note [106].
88	I.e., through independent reasoning or observation.
89	Lit., "worse than this" - i.e., "more painful than the repugnance which you feel with regard to God's messages".
90	I.e., the prophets and the angels are but created beings having no share whatever in His omniscience and, hence, no claim to being worshipped.
91	For an explanation of this rendering of the phrase ma bayna aydihim wa-ma khalfahum, see surah {2}, note [247].
92	The absence of any "hardship" in the religion of Islam is due to several factors: (1) it is free of any dogma or mystical proposition which might make the Qur'anic doctrine difficult to understand or might even conflict with man's innate reason; (2) it avoids all complicated ritual or system of taboos which would impose undue restrictions on man's everyday life; (3) it rejects all self-mortification and exaggerated asceticism, which must unavoidably conflict with man's true nature (cf. in this connection note [118] on the first sentence of {2:143}); and (4) it takes fully into account the fact that "man has been created weak" ({4:28}).
93	Abraham is designated here as "your forefather" not only because he was, in fact, an ancestor of the Prophet Muhammad - to whose followers this passage is addressed - but also because he is the prototype (and thus, the spiritual "forefather") of all who consciously "surrender themselves to God" (see next note).
94	The term muslim signifies "one who surrenders himself to God"; correspondingly, islam denotes "self-surrender to God". Both these terms are applied in the Qur'an to all who believe in the One God and affirm this belief by an unequivocal acceptance of His revealed messages. Since the Qur'an represents the final and most universal of these divine revelations, the believers are called upon, in the sequence, to follow the guidance of its Apostle and thus to become an example for all mankind (cf. {2:143} and the corresponding note [119]).
