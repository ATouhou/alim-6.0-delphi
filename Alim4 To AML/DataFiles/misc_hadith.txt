   Ibn 'Umar related that Rasulullah (PBUH) said:
Islam is based on five things:  bearing witness that there is no
god except Allah and that Muhammad (PBUH) is Allah's Messenger; to
observe Salat; to fast during Ramadan; to pay the Zakat and to
preform Hajj to Allah's house.

   Abu Hurairah related that Rasulullah (PBUH) said: Faith has between
seventy and eighty grades, the highest of which is attesting that, "That
there is no god except Allah," while the lowest one is to remove from a
path something which might cause harm.  Modesty, too, is a grade of
faith.

   Mu'adh bin Jabal said that he asked Rasulullah (PBUH) what was the
most excellent aspect of faith, and he replied:  That you should love
for Allah's sake, hate for Allah's sake, and employ your tongue in
remembering Allah, and that you should like other people to have what
you like for yourself, and dislike that they should have what you
dislike yourself.

   Abu Umamah reported that a man once asked Rasulullah (PBUH), "What is
faith?"  He replied:  When your good deeds make you happy, and when your
bad deeds make you sad, you have faith.  And then the man asked him,
"What is sin?"  And Rasulullah (PBUH) replied:  When anything pricks
your conscience, avoid it.
                                        --(Ahmad)

[This is a very useful rule.  If we do not know what Islam says about
something, but we feel bad when we do it, then it is almost certainly
wrong.]

   Umar ibn Khattab related: One day, when we were sitting with
Rasulullah (PBUH), there appeared a man with very white clothing and
very black hair.  No mark of travel was visible on him, and none of us
recognized him.  Sitting down beside Rasulullah (PBUH) touching his
knees against his, and placing his hands on his thighs, he said, "Tell
me, Muhammad (PBUH) about Islam."  He replied:  Islam means that you
should bear witness that there is no god except Allah and that Muhammad
is Allah's Messenger, that you should do the Salat, pay the Zakat, fast
during Ramadan, and preform Hajj to the House (of Allah) if you have the
means to go.  The man said, "You have spoken the truth."  We were
astonished at his questioning and then declaring that he spoke the
truth.  He said, "Now tell me about Iman."  Rasulullah (PBUH) replied:
It means that you should believe in Allah, His Angels, His Books, His
Messengers, and the Last Day, and that you should believe in the
decreeing of both good and evil.  The man said,"You have spoken the
truth." and then said, "Tell me about Ihsan."  Rasulullah (PBUH) replied:
It means that you should worship Allah as though you see Him, for even
though you do not see Him, still, He sees you.  The man said, "Now tell
me about the Hour (The Day of Judgement)."  And Rasulullah (PBUH)
replied:The one who is asked about it does not know more than the one
who is asking.  He said, "then tell me about its signs."  Rasulullah
(PBUH) replied:  Slave-girls will give birth to their to their own
mistresses, and you will see bare-footed, naked, poor men, and shepherds
competing in putting up high buildings.  'Umar said: He then went away,
and after I had waited for some time Rasulullah (PBUH) said to me:  Do
you know who the questioner was 'Umar?  I replied,"Allah and His
Messenger know best."  "He was Angel Jibriel," Rasulullah (PBUH) said,
"Who came to teach you your religion."

   'Abdullah ibn Mas'ud related that Rasulullah (PBUH) once recited this
verse,  "And whoever Allah wishes to guide, He opens his heart to
Islam"[6:125].  He then explained it by saying:  When faith enters the
heart, it opens it up.  He was then asked, "O Messenger of Allah!  Is
there a sign by which this may be recognized?"  And he said:  Yes.  To
lose interest in the place of deception, to long for the Place of
Eternity, and to prepare for death before it comes.

   Anas related that Rasulullah (PBUH) said:  Faith belongs to whoever
has three things:  to love Allah and His Messenger more than anything
else, to love and be loved for the sake of Allah, and to hate returning
to unbelief just as much as one would hate to be thrown into the fire.

   Ibn 'Abbas related, One day I was riding behind Rasulullah (PBUH)
when he said:  I want to teach you some things.  Obey Allah, and He
will look after you.  Obey His commands, and he will always be on
your side.  When you ask, ask only from him, and when you seek help,
seek help from him alone. Remember that if all men combined to help you
they would be able to help you only in the way Allah has willed.
And if they all combined to harm you, they would be able to harm you
only in the way which Allah has willed.

ten rewards, or even more.  The person who does one evil deed shall
be given only one punishment, or I shall forgive him.  When someone
comes a hand's width closer to Me, I come an arm's length closer to
him.  When someone comes an arm's length closer to Me, I come two arms'
length closer to him.  When someone comes towards me walking, I come
to him running.  And when someone comes to Me with as many sins as the
whole world could contain, I come to him with as much forgiveness as
that.                                   --(Muslim)

Rasulullah (PBUH) asked her why she was crying, and she said:  "I
thought of Hell, and the fear of it made me cry.  Will you remember your
family members that day?", Rasulullah (PBUH) answered:  By Him in Whose
hands is my soul, there are three occasions where no one will remember
anyone else.  First when the Scales of Justice are set up, until it is
known whether one's good deeds will outweigh one's bad deeds.  Second
when the Books of Deeds shall be delivered and on receiving it in his
right hand, one truthful believer will cheerfully say to the other,
"Read it", until the time it is known in which hand it will be
delivered, in the right hand, in the left hand, or from behind.  Third
when the Bridge will be placed over the Bottomless Pit (of Hell), and
every one will be ordered to cross it.

who faces the Day of Judgement having preformed the Salat, Zakat, and
Siyam, but who has insulted someone, slandered someone, misused
someone's money, shed someone's blood and beaten someone else.  Each one
of them shall be given some of his good deeds.  Should he not have
enough good deeds, then he will be given their sins.  Then he will be

together and part for His sake, (5) a man who is called by a beautiful
woman of good family, but refuses her, saying "I fear Allah", (6) a
person who gives his money in charity so secretly that his left hand
does not know what his right hand gives, and (7) someone who remembers
Allah privately, so that his eyes brim with tears.

such-and-such a sin?"  He replies, "Yes, my Lord."  this continues until
he makes him acknowledge his sins, and he feels within himself that he
has perished.  Allah will then say, "I concealed them for you in the
world, and today I forgive them."  he will then be given the record of
his good actions.  But for the unbelievers and the hypocrites it will be
proclaimed in front of all creatures:  "These are the people who lied
against their Lord!  Allah's curse be upon the evildoers!"[11:18]

done to others, and someone who sells his goods by swearing falsely.

weakness crept into the Children of Israel this way.  One of them would
meet another and say to him:  Fear Allah and give up (the wrong) that
you are doing.  Then he would meet him the next day and find no change
in him, but this would not prevent him from eating, drinking, and
befriending with him.  When they came to this stage, their hearts were
perverted on account of their associations.  He continued and said:  By
Allah!  You must enjoin good and forbid evil and seize the hand of the
wrongdoer and persuade him to act justly and establish him firmly on the
right, otherwise Allah will change your hearts and will curse you as he
cursed them.

   'Umar ibn Khattab reported:  I once went to Rasulullah (PBUH) and saw
that he was lying on a mat of leaves of date-palm, and there was nothing
between him and the mat, and the texture of the mat left deep marks on
his body, and under his head was a pillow stuffed with date-bark.  On
seeing this I said to him: "O my Master!  Pray to Allah to grant
prosperity to your followers.  He has bestowed riches to the people of
Rome and Persia even though they are not believers."  Rasulullah (PBUH)
replied:  O 'Umar!  Do you not prefer that they take the joys of this
world and we of the Hereafter?

   'Abdullah ibn 'Amr reported:  Rasulullah (PBUH) once saw two
assemblies in his mosque and said:  Both are blessed but one is better
than the other:  Those who are engaged in Allah's dhikr, call upon Allah
and seek His help.  If Allah wills, He gives them what they ask for and if
he wills, he denies it to them.  The other are engaged in learning and
teaching others.  They are therefore better than the first.  I have been
sent as a teacher.  Saying this he sat down amongst them.
