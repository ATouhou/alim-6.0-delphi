.hadithNarrator Abdullah ibn Umar ibn al-Khattab
It is narrated on the authority of Yahya ibn Ya'mar that the first man who discussed Qadr (Divine Decree) in Basrah was Ma'bad al-Juhani.  Humayd ibn AbdurRahman al-Himyari and I set out for Pilgrimage or for Umrah and said: Should it so happen that we come into contact with one of the Companions of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) we shall ask him about what is talked about Taqdir (Division Decree). Accidentally we came across Abdullah ibn Umar ibn al-Khattab, while he was entering the mosque. My companion and I surrounded him. One of us (stood) on his right and the other stood on his left. I expected that my companion would authorize me to speak.  I therefore said: AbuAbdurRahman! There have appeared some people in our land who recite the Holy Qur'an and pursue knowledge.  And then after talking about their affairs, added: They (such people) claim that there is no such thing as Divine Decree and events are not predestined.  He (Abdullah ibn Umar) said: When you happen to meet such people tell them that I have nothing to do with them and they have nothing to do with me. And verily they are in no way responsible for my (belief). Abdullah ibn Umar swore by Him (the Lord) (and said): If any one of them (who does not believe in the Divine Decree) had with him gold equal to the bulk of (the mountain) Uhud and then, it (in the way of Allah), Allah would not accept it unless he affirmed his faith in Divine Decree. He further said: My father, Umar ibn al-Khattab, told me: One day we were sitting in the company of Allah's Apostle (peace be upon him) when there appeared before us a man dressed in pure white clothes, his hair extraordinarily black. There were no signs of travel on him. None amongst us recognized him. At last he sat with the Apostle (peace be upon him) He knelt before him placed his palms on his thighs and said: Muhammad, inform me about al-Islam. The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said: Al-Islam implies that you testify that there is no god but Allah and that Muhammad is the messenger of Allah, and you establish prayer, pay Zakat, observe the fast of Ramadan, and perform pilgrimage to the (House) if you are solvent enough (to bear the expense of) the journey. He (the inquirer) said: You have told the truth. He (Umar ibn al-Khattab) said: It amazed us that he would put the question and then he would himself verify the truth. He (the inquirer) said: Inform me about Iman (faith). He (the Holy Prophet) replied: That you affirm your faith in Allah, in His angels, in His Books, in His Apostles, in the Day of Judgment, and you affirm your faith in the Divine Decree about good and evil. He (the inquirer) said: You have told the truth. He (the inquirer) again said: Inform me about al-Ihsan (performance of good deeds). He (the Holy Prophet) said: That you worship Allah as if you are seeing Him, for though you don't see Him, He, verily, sees you.  He (the enquirer) again said: Inform me about the hour (of the Doom). He (the Holy Prophet) remarked: One who is asked knows no more than the one who is inquiring (about it). He (the inquirer) said: Tell me some of its indications. He (the Holy Prophet) said: That the slave-girl will give birth to her mistress and master, that you will find barefooted, destitute goat-herds vying with one another in the construction of magnificent buildings. He (the narrator, Umar ibn al-Khattab) said: Then he (the inquirer) went on his way but I stayed with him (the Holy Prophet) for a long while. He then, said to me: Umar, do you know who this inquirer was? I replied: Allah and His Apostle knows best. He (the Holy Prophet) remarked: He was Gabriel (the angel). He came to you in order to instruct you in matters of religion.

.hadithNarrator Anas ibn Malik
We were forbidden to ask anything (without genuine need) from the Holy Prophet. It therefore pleased us that an intelligent person from the dwellers of the desert should come and ask him (the Holy Prophet) and we should listen to it. A man from the dwellers of the desert came (to the Holy Prophet) and said: Muhammad, your messenger came to us and told us your assertion that verily Allah had sent you (as a prophet). He (the Holy Prophet) remarked: He told the truth. He (the Bedouin) said: Who created Heaven? He (the Holy Prophet) replied: Allah. He (the Bedouin again) said: Who created Earth? He (the Holy Prophet) replied: Allah. He (the Bedouin again) said: Who raised these mountains and who created in them whatever is created there? He (the Holy Prophet) replied: Allah. Upon this he (the Bedouin) remarked: By Him Who created Heaven and created Earth and raised mountains thereupon, has Allah (in fact) sent you? He (the Holy Prophet) said: Yes. He (the Bedouin) said: Your messenger also told us that five prayers (had been made) obligatory for us during the day and the night. He (the Holy Prophet) remarked: He told you the truth. He (the Bedouin) said: By Him Who sent you, is it Allah Who ordered you about this (i.e. prayers)? He (the Holy Prophet) said: Yes. He (the Bedouin) said: Your messenger told us that Zakat had been made obligatory on our riches. He (the Holy Prophet) said: He has told the truth. He (the Bedouin) said: By Him Who sent you (as a prophet), is it Allah Who ordered you about it (Zakat)? He (the Prophet said: Yes. He (the Bedouin) said: Your messenger told us that it had been made obligatory for us to fast every year during the month of Ramadan. He (the Holy Prophet) said: He has told the truth. He (the Bedouin) said: By Him Who sent you (as a prophet), is it Allah Who ordered you about it (the fasts of Ramadan)? He (the Holy Prophet) said: Yes.  He (the Bedouin) said: Your messenger also told us that a pilgrimage (Hajj) to the House (of Ka'bah) had been made obligatory for him who was able to undertake the journey to it. He (the Holy Prophet) said: Yes. The narrator said that he (the Bedouin) set off (at the conclusion of this answer, but at the time of his departure) remarked: By Him Who sent you with the Truth, I should neither make any addition to them nor should I remove anything from them.  Upon this the Holy Prophet remarked: If he were true (to what he said) he must enter Paradise.

.hadithNarrator AbuSa'id al-Khudri
People from the tribe of AbdulQays came to the Allah's Apostle (peace be upon him) and said: Messenger of Allah, we belong to the tribe of Rabi'ah; there live between you and us the unbelievers of the Mudar tribe so we find it impossible to come to you except in the sacred months. Direct us to a deed which we must communicate to those who have been left behind us and by doing which we may enter Heaven. Upon this the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said: I enjoin upon you four (things) and forbid you to do four (things): worship Allah and associate none with Him, establish prayer, pay Zakat, and observe the fast of Ramadan, and pay the fifth part out of the booty. And I prohibit you from four (things): dry gourds, green-coloured jars, hollowed stumps of palm-trees, and receptacles. They (the members of the delegation) said: Do you know what an-naqir is?  He replied: Yes, it is a stump which you hollow out and in which you throw small dates.  Sa'id said: He (the Holy Prophet) used the word tamar (dates).  (The Holy Prophet then added): Then you sprinkle water over it and when its fermentation subsides, you drink it (and you are so intoxicated) that one amongst you, or one amongst them (the other members of your tribe, who were not present there) strikes his cousin with the sword. He (the narrator) said: There was a man amongst us who had sustained injury on this very account due to (intoxication), and he said that he tried to conceal it, out of shame, from the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him).  I however inquired from the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) (if we discard those utensils which you have forbidden us to use), then what type of vessels should be used for drink?  (The Holy Prophet) replied: The water-skins the mouths of which are tied (with a string).  They (again) said: Prophet of Allah, our land abounds in rats and water-skins cannot remain intact. The Holy Prophet of Allah (peace be upon him) said: Drink from water-skins) even if these are nibbled by rats. And then (addressing) al-Ashajj of AbdulQays, he said: Verily, you posses two such qualities which Allah loves: insight and deliberateness.

We were accompanying the Apostle of Allah (peace be upon him) in a march (towards Tabuk). He (the narrator) said: The provisions of the people were almost depleted. He (the narrator) said: (And the situation became so critical) that they (the men of the army) decided to slaughter some of their camels.  He (the narrator) said: Upon this Umar said: Messenger of Allah, I wish you to pool what has been left from the provisions of the people and then invoke (the blessings of) Allah upon it. He (the narrator) said: He (the Holy Prophet) did it accordingly. He (the narrator) said: The one who had wheat in his possession brought wheat. He who had dates with him brought dates.  And Mujahid said: He who possessed date-stone brought date-stones.  I (the narrator) said: What did they do with the date-stones?  They said: They (the people) sucked them and then drank water over them.  He (the narrator said): He (the Holy Prophet) invoked the blessings (of Allah) upon them (the provisions). He (the narrator) said: (And there was such a miraculous increase in the supplies) that the people replenished their provisions fully. He (the narrator) said:  At that time he (the Holy Prophet) said: I bear testimony to the fact that there is no god but Allah, and I am His messenger. The bondsman who meets Allah without entertaining any doubt about these (two fundamentals) will enter heaven.

(The narrator A'mash has narrated this hadith with a little doubt (about the name of the very first narrator who was in direct contact with the Holy Prophet. He was either AbuHurayrah or AbuSa'id al-Khudri. Both are equally reliable transmitters of the traditions). He (the narrator) said: During the time of the Tabuk expedition, the (provisions) ran short and the men (of the army) suffered from starvation.  They said: Messenger of Allah, will you permit us to slay our camels? We shall eat them and use their fat. The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said: Do as you please.  He (the narrator) said: Then Umar came there and said: Messenger of Allah, if you do that (if you give your consent and the men begin to slay their camels), we shall be short of riding-animals. But (I should suggest that you) summon them to bring their remaining provisions. Then invoke Allah's blessings on them (different items of the provisions).  It is hoped Allah will bless them. The Messenger of Allah replied in the affirmative.  He (the narrator) said: He called for a leather mat to be used as a table-cloth and spread it out. Then he called the people to bring the remaining portions of their provisions. He (the narrator said: Someone was coming with a handful of mote, another was coming with a handful of dates, still another was coming with a portion of bread, until small quantities of these things were collected on the table cloth.  He (the narrator said): Then the Messenger of Allah, invoked blessing (on them) and said: Fill your utensils with these provisions. He (the narrator) said: They filled their vessels to the brim with them, and no one amongst the army (which comprised 30,000 people) was left even with a single empty vessel. He (the narrator) said: They ate their fill, and there was still a surplus.  Upon this the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) remarked: I bear testimony that there is no god but Allah and I am the Messenger of Allah. The man who meets his Lord without harbouring any doubt about these two (truths) will never be kept away from Paradise.

.hadithNarrator AbuHurayrah
We were sitting around the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him); AbuBakr and Umar were also there among the audience. In the meanwhile the Messenger of Allah rose and left us. He delayed in coming back to us, which caused anxiety that he might have been attacked by some enemy when we were not with him; so being alarmed we rose.  I was the first to be alarmed. I therefore went out to look for the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) and came to a garden belonging to the Banu an-Najjar, a section of the Ansar. I went round it looking for a gate but failed to find one. Seeing a rabi' (i.e. streamlet) flowing into the garden from a well outside, I crouched, like a fox, and slunk into (the place) where Allah Messenger was.  He the Holy Prophet) said: Is it AbuHurayrah?  I (AbuHurayrah) replied: Yes, Messenger of Allah.  He (the Holy Prophet) said: What is the matter with you?  I replied: You were amongst us but rose, went away and delayed for a time, so fearing that you might be attacked by some enemy when we were not with you, we became alarmed. I was the first to be alarmed. So when I came to this garden, I crouched as a fox does, and these people are following me.  He addressed me as AbuHurayrah and gave me his sandals and said: Take away these sandals of mine, and when you meet anyone outside this garden who testifies that there is no god but Allah, being assured of it in his heart, gladden him by announcing that he shall go to Paradise.  Now the first one I met was Umar.  He asked: What are these sandals, AbuHurayrah?  I replied: These are the sandals of the Messenger, of Allah with which he has sent me to gladden anyone I meet, who testifies that there is no god but Allah, being assured of it in his heart, with the announcement that he will go to Paradise.  Thereupon Umar struck me on the breast and I fell on my back. He then said: Go back, AbuHurayrah.  So I returned to the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) and I was about to burst into tears. Umar followed me closely and there he was behind me.  The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said: What is the matter with you, AbuHurayrah?  I said: I happened to meet Umar and conveyed to him the message with which you sent me. He struck me on my breast which made me fall down upon my back and ordered me to go back.  Upon this the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said: What prompted you to do this, Umar?  He said: Messenger of Allah, my mother and father be sacrificed to thee, did you send AbuHurayrah with your sandals to gladden anyone he met who testified that there was no god but Allah, and being assured of it in his heart, with the tidings that he would go to Paradise?  He said: Yes.  Umar said: Please do not do it, for I am afraid that people will trust in it alone; let them go on doing (good) deeds.  The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said: Well, let them.

Then there came after them their successors who said that which they did not practise, and practised that which they were not commanded to do. He who strove against them with his hand was a believer, he who strove against them with his tongue was a believer, and he who strove against them with his heart was a believer, and beyond that there was no faith, not even as much as a mustard seed.  AbuRafi' said: I narrated this hadith to Abdullah ibn Umar; he contradicted me. There happened to come Abdullah ibn Mas'ud who stayed at Qanat, and Abdullah ibn Umar wanted me to accompany him on a visit to him (as Abdullah ibn Mas'ud was ailing), so I went with him.

.hadithNarrator Jundab ibn Abdullah al-Bajali
It is narrated by Safwan ibn Muhriz that Jundab, during the stormy days of Ibn Zubayr, sent a message to As'as ibn Salamah: Gather some men of your family so that I may talk to them. He (As'as) sent a messenger to them (to the members of his family).  When they had assembled, Jundab came there wearing a yellow hooded cloak.  He said: Talk about what you were busy discussing. The talk went on in turns, until there came his (Jundab's) turn.  He took off the hooded cloak from his head and said: I have come to you with no other intention but to narrate to you a hadith of your Apostle (peace be upon him).  Verily the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) sent a squad of the Muslims to a tribe of the polytheists. Both armies confronted each other. There was a man among the army of polytheists who (was such a fanatic that), whenever he intended to kill a man from among the Muslims, he killed him. Amongst the Muslims too was a man looking forward to (an opportunity of) his (the polytheist's) unmindfulness.  He (the narrator) said: We said that he was Usamah ibn Zayd. When he raised his sword, he (the soldier of the polytheists) uttered: "There is no god but Allah," but he (Usamah ibn Zayd) killed him.  When the messenger of the glad tidings came to the Apostle (peace be upon him) he asked him (about the events of the battle) and he informed him about the man (Usamah) and what he had done. He (the Prophet of Allah) called for him and asked him why he had killed him. He (Usamah) said: Messenger of Allah, he struck the Muslims and killed such and such of them. And he even named some of them. (He continued): I attacked him and when he saw the sword he said: There is no god but Allah. The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said: Did you kill him? He (Usamah) replied in the affirmative.  He (the Holy Prophet) remarked: What would you do with: "There is no god but Allah," if he came (before you) on the Day of Judgment?  He (Usamah) said: Messenger of Allah, beg pardon for me (from your Lord). He (the Holy Prophet) said: What would you do with: "There is no god but Allah" if he came (before you) on the Day of Judgment?  He (the Holy Prophet) added nothing to it but continued to say: What would you do with: "There is no god but Allah," if he came (before you) on the Day of Judgment?

The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) happened to pass by a heap of eatables (corn). He thrust his hand in that (heap) and his fingers were moistened. He said to the owner of the heap of eatables (corn): What is this? Messenger of Allah, these have been drenched by rainfall. He (the Prophet) remarked: Why did you not place this (the drenched part of the heap) over other eatables so that the people could see it? He who deceives is not of me (is not my follower).

Tufayl, son of Amr ad-Dawsi, came to the Apostle (peace be upon him) and said: Do you need strong, fortified protection? The tribe of Daws had a fort in the pre-Islamic days. The Apostle (peace be upon him) declined this offer, since it (the privilege of protecting the Holy Prophet) had already been reserved for the Ansar.  When the Apostle (peace be upon him) migrated to Medina, Tufayl, son of Amr, also migrated to that place, and there also migrated with him a man of his tribe. But the climate of Medina did not suit him, and he fell sick. He felt very uneasy. So he took hold of an iron head of an arrow and cut his finger-joints. The blood streamed forth from his hands until he died.  Tufayl, son of Amr, saw him in a dream. His health was good and he saw him with his hands wrapped.  He (Tufayl) said to him: What treatment did your Allah accord to you?  He replied: Allah granted me pardon for my migration to the Apostle (peace be upon him):  He (Tufayl) again said: What is this that I see covering your hands?  He replied: I was told (by Allah): We should not set right anything of yours which you damaged yourself.  Tufayl narrated this (dream) to the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him).  Upon this he prayed: O Allah! Grant pardon even to his hands.

The Apostle (peace be upon him) asked Sa'd ibn Mu'adh about him and said: AbuAmr, how is Thabit? Has he fallen sick?  Sa'd said: He is my neighbour, but I do not know of his illness. Sa'd came to him (Thabit), and conveyed to him the message of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him). Upon this Thabit verse was revealed, and you are well aware of the fact that, amongst all of you, mine is the voice louder than that of the Messenger of Allah, and so I am one of the denizens of Fire.

Ibn Shamasah said: We went to Amr ibn al-'As and he was about to die. He wept for a long time and turned his face towards the wall. His son said: Did the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) not give you tidings of this? Did the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) not give you tidings of this?  He (the narrator) said: He turned his face (towards the audience) and said: The best thing which we can count upon is the testimony that there is no god but Allah and that Muhammad is the Apostle of Allah. Verily I have passed through three phases. (The first was one) in which I found myself averse to none else more than I was averse to the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) and there was no other desire stronger in me than the one that I should overpower him and kill him. Had I died in this state, I should have been definitely one of the denizens of Fire.  When Allah instilled the love of Islam in my heart, I came to the Apostle (peace be upon him) and said: Stretch out your right hand so that I may pledge my allegiance to you. He stretched out his right hand. I withdrew my hand.  He (the Holy Prophet) said: What has happened to you, O' Amr? I replied: I intend to lay down a condition.  He asked: What condition do you intend to put forward?  I said: I should be granted pardon.  He (the Holy Prophet) observed: Are you not aware of the fact that Islam wipes out all the previous (misdeeds)? Verily migration wipes out all the previous (misdeeds) and verily the pilgrimage wipes out all the (previous) misdeeds.  After that no one was more dear to me than the Messenger of Allah and none was more sublime in my eyes than he. Never could I pluck up courage to catch a full glimpse of his face due to its splendour. So if I am asked to describe his features, I cannot do that for I have not eyed him fully. Had I died in this state I had every reason to hope that I should have been among the dwellers of Paradise. Then we were responsible for certain things (in the light of which) I am unable to know what is in store for me. When I die, let neither female mourner nor fire accompany me. When you bury me, fill my grave well with earth, then stand around it for a time which a camel is slaughtered and its meat is distributed so that I may enjoy your intimacy and (in your company) ascertain what answer I can give to the messengers (angels) of Allah.

When it was revealed to the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him): "To Allah belongs whatever is in the Heavens and whatever is Earth and whether you disclose that which is in your mind or conceal it, Allah will call you to account according to it. Then He forgives whom He pleases and chastises whom He please; and Allah has power over everything" (ii.284), the Companion of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) felt it to be hard and severe. They came to the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) and kneeling down, said: Messenger of Allah, we were assigned some duties which were within our power to perform, such as prayer, fasting, struggling (in the cause of Allah), charity. Then this (the above-mentioned) verse was revealed unto you and it is beyond our power to live up to it. The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said: Do you intend to say what the people of two books (Jews and Christians) said before you: "We hear and disobey"? You should rather say: "We hear and we obey, (we seek) Thy forgiveness, our Lord! And unto Thee is the return."  And they said: "We hear and we obey, (we seek) Thy forgiveness, our Lord! and unto Thee is the return."  When the people recited it and it flowed smoothly from their tongues, then Allah revealed immediately afterwards: "The apostle believes in that which is sent down unto him from his Lord, and so do the believers. Each one believes in Allah, His angels, His Books and His apostles, saying: We differentiate not between any of His apostles; and they say: We hearken and we obey; (we seek) Thy forgiveness, our Lord! And unto Thee is the return" (ii.285). When they did that, Allah abrogated this (verse) and the Great, Majestic Allah revealed: "Allah burdens not a soul beyond its capacity. It receives every good that it earns and it suffers every ill that it earns. Our Lord, punish us not if we forget or make a mistake."  (The Prophet said): Yes, our Lord! do not lay on us a burden as Thou didst lay on those before us. (The Prophet said:) Yes, our Lord, impose not on us (burdens) which we have not the strength to bear. (The Prophet said:) Yes, and pardon us and grant us protection! And have mercy on us. Thou art our Patron, so grant us victory over the disbelieving people" (ii.286).  He (the Lord) said: Yes.

Then the light of the hypocrites would be extinguished, and the believers would secure salvation. The first group to achieve it would comprise seventy thousand men who would have the brightness of the full moon on their faces, and they would not be called to account. Then the faces of the people immediately following them will be like the brightest stars in Heaven. This is how (the groups would follow one after another).

Therefore turn to thy Lord for prayer and offer sacrifice, and surely thy enemy is cut off (from the good").  Then he (the Holy Prophet) said: Do you know what Kawthar is? We said: Allah and His Messenger know best. The Holy Prophet (peace be upon him) said: It (Kawthar) is a canal which my Lord, the Exalted and Glorious, has promised me, and there is an abundance of good in it. It is a cistern and my people will come to it on the Day of Resurrection, and tumblers there would be equal to the number of stars. A servant will be turned away from (among those gathered there).  Upon this I shall say: My Lord, he is one of my people.  He (the Lord) will say: You do not know that he created new things (in Islam) after you.  Ibn Hujr made this addition in the hadith: "He (the Holy Prophet) was sitting amongst us in the mosque, and He (Allah) said: (You don't know) what he innovated after you."

Wa'il saw the Apostle of Allah (peace be upon him) raising his hands at the time of beginning the prayer and reciting takbir, and according to Hammam (the narrator), the hands were lifted opposite to ears. He (the Prophet) then wrapped his hands in his cloth and placed his right hand over his left hand. And when he was about to bow down, he brought out his hands from the cloth, and then lifted them, and then recited takbir and bowed down, and when (he came back to the erect position) he recited: Allah listened to him who praised Him." And when prostrated, he prostrated between the two palms.

When AbuMusa was (praying and was) in the qa'dah, one of the people said: The prayer has been made obligatory together with piety and Zakat.  He (the narrator) said: When AbuMusa had finished the prayer after salutation he turned (towards the people) and said: Who amongst you said such and such a thing? A hush fell on the people. He again said: Who amongst you has said such and such a thing? A hush fell on the people. He (AbuMusa) said: Hattan, it is perhaps you that have uttered it.  He (Hattan) said: No, I have not uttered it. I was afraid that you might be annoyed with me on account of this. Someone amongst the people said: It was I who said it, and in this I intended nothing but good.  AbuMusa said: Don't you know what you have to recite in your prayers? Verily the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) addressed us and explained to us all its aspects and taught us how to observe prayer (properly). He (the Holy Prophet) said: When you pray make your row straight and one of you should act as your Imam. Recite the takbir when he recites it and when he recites: Not of those with whom Thou art angry, nor of those who go astray, say: Amin. Allah will respond to you. And when he (the Imam) recites the takbir, you may also recite the takbir, for the Imam bows before you and raises himself before you. Then the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said: The one is equivalent to the other. When he says: Allah listens to him who praises Him, you should say: O Allah, our Lord, to Thee be the praise, for Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, has vouchsafed (us) through the tongue of His Apostle (peace be upon him) that Allah hears him who praises Him. When he (the Imam) recites the takbir and prostrates, you should also recite the takbir and prostrate, for the Imam prostrates before you and raises himself before you. The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said: The one is equivalent to the other. When he (the Imam) sits for Qa'dah (for tashahhud) the first words of every one amongst you should be: All services rendered by words, acts of worship and all good things are due to Allah. Peace be upon you, O Apostle, and Allah's mercy and blessings. Peace be upon us and upon the upright servants of Allah. I testify that there is no god but Allah, and I testify that Muhammad is His servant and His Messenger.

When he bowed he neither kept his head up nor bent it down, but kept it between these extremes; when he raised his head after bowing he did not prostrate himself till he had stood erect; when he raised his head after prostration he did not prostrate himself again till he sat u(peace be upon him) At the end of every two rak'ahs he recited the tahiyyah; and he used to place his left foot flat (on the ground) and raise up the right; he prohibited the devil's way of sitting on the heels, and he forbade people to spread out their arms like a wild beast. And he used to finish the prayer with the taslim.

Some people have suggested that appoint my successor. Allah will not destroy His religion, His caliphate and that with which He sent His Apostle (peace be upon him). If death come to me soon, the (issue of) caliphate (will be decided) by the consent of these six men with whom the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) remained well pleased until his death. I know full well that some people would blame me for kill with these very hands of mine some persons who apparently professed (Islam). If they do this (blame me) they are the enemies of Allah, and are non-believers; they have gone astray. I do not leave after me anything which to my mind seems more important than Kalalah. I never turned towards the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) (for guidance) more often than this Kalalah, and he (the Holy Prophet) was not annoyed with me on any other (issue) than this. (He was so perturbed) that he struck his fingers on my chest and said: Does this verse, that is at the end of Surat an-Nisa', which was revealed in the hot season, not suffice you? And if I live longer I would decide this (problem so clearly) that one who reads the Qur'an, or one who does not read it, would be able to make (correct) decisions (under its light). He (Umar) further said: Allah! I call You witness to these governors of lands, that I sent them to (the peoples of these lands) so that they might administer justice amongst them, teach them their religion, and the Sunnah of the Apostle of Allah (peace be upon him), distribute amongst them the spoils of war and refer to me that which they find difficult to perform. O people, you eat these two plants, onions and garlic, and I find them extremely repugnant for I saw that when the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) sensed the odour of these two from someone in a mosque, he was made to go to al-Baqi'.

He then commanded and Iqamah for the evening prayer was pronounced, when the sun had set. He then gave him the command and the Iqamah for the night prayer was pronounced when the twilight had disappeared. Later he gave him the command and the Iqamah for the morning prayer was pronounced when the dawn had appeared.  When it was the next day, he commanded him to delay the noon prayer until the extreme heat had passed and he did so, and he allowed it to be delayed till the extreme heat had passed. He observed the afternoon prayer when the sun was high, delaying it beyond the time he had previously observed it. He observed the evening prayer before the twilight had vanished; he observed the night prayer when a third of the night had passed; and he observed the dawn prayer when there was clear daylight.  He (the Holy Prophet) then said: Where is the man who inquired about the time of prayer?  He (the inquirer) said: Messenger of Allah! Here I am.  He (the Holy Prophet) said: The time for your prayer is within the limits of what you have seen.

Someone came to the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) to enquire about the times of prayers. He (the Holy Prophet) gave him no reply (because he wanted to explain to him the times by observing these prayers in practice).  He then said the morning prayer when it was daybreak, but the people could hardly recognize one another. He then gave the command and the Iqamah for the noon prayer was pronounced when the sun had passed the meridian; one would say that it was midday but he (the Holy Prophet) knew better than they did. He then again gave the command and the Iqamah for the afternoon prayer was pronounced when the sun was high. He then gave the command and the Iqamah for the evening prayer was pronounced when the sun had set. He then gave the command and Iqamah for the night prayer was pronounced when the twilight had disappeared.  He delayed the morning prayer on the next day (so much so) that after returning from it one would say that the sun had risen or it was about to rise. He then delayed the noon prayer until it was near the time of afternoon prayer (as it was observed on the previous day). He delayed the afternoon prayer until one returning from it would say that the sun had become red. He then delayed the evening prayer until the twilight was about to disappear. He delayed the night prayer until one-third of the night had passed.  He then called the inquirer in the morning and said: The time for prayers is between these two (extremes).

The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) addressed us and said: You will travel in the evening and at night until (God willing) you will come in the morning to a watering-place. So the people travelled (self-absorbed) without paying any heed to one another, and the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) also travelled until it was midnight. I was by his side. The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) began to doze and leaned (to one side) of his camel. I came to him and I lent him support without awaking him until he sat upright on his mount. He continued to travel until a major part of the night was over and (he again) leaned (to one side) of his camel. I supported him without awaking him till he sat upright on his mount, and then travelled until it was nearly dawn. He (again) leaned more sharply than on the two earlier occasions and he was about to fall down. So I came to him and supported him. He lifted his head and said: Who is this?  I said: It is AbuQatadah.  He (the Holy Prophet again) said: For how long have you been travelling with me like this?  I said: I have been travelling in this very state since midnight.  He said: May Allah protect you, as you have protected His Apostle (peace be upon him) (from falling down). He continued: Do you see that we were hidden from the people? and again said: Do you see anyone?  I said: Here is a rider. I again said: Here is another rider, until we gathered together and we were seven riders. The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) stepped off the highway, placed his head (for sleep and said): Guard for us our prayers. The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) was the first to wake up and the rays of the sun were falling on his back. We rose, startled.  He (the Holy Prophet) said: Ride on. So we rode on until the sun had (sufficiently) risen. He then came down from his camel and called for a jug of water that I had with me. There was a little water in that. With it he performed an ablution that was less thorough as compared with his usual ablutions when some of the water was left over. He (the Holy Prophet) said to AbuQatadah: Keep a watch over your jug of water; it will be on (a miraculous) condition. Then Bilal summoned (people) to prayer. The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) observed two rak'ahs and then said the morning prayer as he said it every day. The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) (then) rode on. We rode with him and some of us whispered to the others, saying: How will there be compensation for omission in our prayers? Upon this he (the Apostle of Allah) said: Is there not in my (my life) a model for you? There is no omission in sleeping. The (cognizable) omission is that one does not say prayer (intentionally) until the time of the next prayer comes. So he who does thus (omits prayer in sleep or due to other unavoidable circumstances) should say prayer when he becomes aware of it and on the next day he should observe it at its prescribed time. He (the Holy Prophet) said: What do you think the people would have done (at this hour)? They would have found in the morning that their Apostle was missing from amongst them and then AbuBakr and Umar would have told them that the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) must be behind them, he could not leave them behind (him), but the people would have said: The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) is ahead of you. So if you had obeyed AbuBakr and Umar, you would have gone on the right path. So we proceeded until we came up to the people (behind whom we had been lagging). The day had advanced considerably risen and everything became hot. They (the companions of the Holy Prophet) said: Messenger of Allah, we are dying of thirst. Upon this he (the Holy Prophet) remarked: There is no destruction for you. And again said: Bring the small cup of mine; and then he asked for the jug of water to be brought to him. The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) began to pour water (into that small cup) and AbuQatadah gave it to them to drink. When the people saw that there was (a little) water in the jug, they fell upon it.  Upon this the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said: Behave well; the water (is enough) to satisfy all of you. Then they (the companions) began to receive (their share of) water with calmness (without showing any anxiety). The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) continued to fill (the cup) and I continued to serve them until no one was left except myself and the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him).  He then filled (the cup) with water and said to me: Drink it.  I said: Messenger of Allah, I should not drink until you have drunk.  Upon this he said: The server of the people is the last of them to drink. So I drank and the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) also drank and the people came to the watering-place quite happy and satisfied. Abdullah ibn Rabah said: I am going to narrate this hadith in the great mosque, when Imran ibn Husayn said: See, O young man, how will you narrate it for I was also one of the riders that night?  I said: So you must know this hadith well.  He said: Who are you?  I said: I am one of the Ansar.  Upon this he said: You narrate it, for you know your hadith better. I therefore narrated it to the people.  Imran said: I was also present that night, but I know not anyone else who learnt it so well as you have learnt it.

Sa'd ibn Hisham ibn Amir decided to participate in the expedition for the sake of Allah, so he came to Medina. He decided to dispose of his property there and buy arms and horses instead in order to fight against the Romans to the end of his life. When he came to Medina he met the people of Medina. They dissuaded him from doing such a thing, and informed him that a group of six men had decided to do so during the lifetime of the Apostle of Allah (peace be upon him) and the Apostle of Allah (peace be upon him) forbade them to do it.  He had said: Is there not for you a model pattern in me? When they narrated this to him (Sa'd ibn Hisham), he returned to his wife, though he had divorced her and made (people) witness to his reconciliation. He then came to Ibn Abbas and asked him about the Witr of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him).  Ibn Abbas said: Should I not lead you to one who knows best amongst the people of the world about the Witr of the Messenger of Allah? He said: Who is it?  (Ibn Abbas) said: It is Aisha. So go to her and ask her (about Witr) and then come to me and inform me of the answer that she gives you. So I came to Hakim ibn Aflah and requested him to take me to her.  He said: I shall not go to her, for I forbade her to say anything (about the conflict) between the two groups, but she refused (to accept my advice) and went (to participate in the conflict). I (requested) him (Hakim) with an oath to lead me to her. So we went to Aisha and we begged permission to meet her. She granted us permission and we went in.  She said: Are you Hakim? (She recognized him.)  He replied: Yes.  She said: Who is there with you?  He said: He is Sa'd ibn Hisham.  She said: Which Hisham? He said:  He is Hisham ibn Amir. She blessed him (Amir) with mercy from Allah and spoke good of him (Qatadah said that he died as a martyr in Uhud). I said: Mother of the Faithful, tell me about the character of the Messenger of Allah.  She said: Don't you read the Qur'an?  I said: Yes.  Upon this she said: The character of the Apostle of Allah (peace be upon him) was the Qur'an. He said: I felt inclined to stand up and not ask anything (further) until death. But then I changed my mind and said: Inform me about the observance (of the night prayer) of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him)  She said: Did you not recite: "O thou wrapped up"?  He said: Yes.  She said: Allah, the Exalted and the Glorious, made the observance of the night prayer at the beginning of this Surah obligatory. So the Apostle of Allah (peace be upon him) and his companions around him observed this (night prayer) for one year. Allah held back the concluding portion of this Surah for twelve months in Heaven until (at the end of this period) Allah revealed the concluding verses of this Surah, which lightened (the burden of this prayer), and the night prayer became a supererogatory prayer after being an obligatory one. I said: Mother of the Faithful, inform me about the Witr of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him).  She said: I used to prepare a tooth-stick for him and water for his ablution, and Allah would rouse him to the extent He wished during the night. He would use the tooth stick,  perform ablution, and would offer nine rak'ahs. He would only sit for the eighth one and would remember Allah, praise Him and supplicate Him, then he would stand up without uttering the salutation and pray the ninth rak'ah. He would then sit, remember Him, praise Him and supplicate Him and then utter a salutation loud enough for us to hear. He would then pray two rak'ahs sitting after uttering the salutation, and that made eleven rak'ahs.  However, my son, when the Apostle of Allah (peace be upon him) grew old and put on flesh, he observed a Witr of seven, doing in two rak'ahs as he had done formerly, and that made nine. O my son, when the Apostle of Allah (peace be upon him) observed prayer, he liked to continue observing it, and when sleep or pain overpowered him and made it impossible (for him) to observe prayer at night, he prayed twelve rak'ahs during the day. I am not aware of Allah's Prophet (peace be upon him) having recited the whole Qur'an during one single night, or praying through the night till morning, or fasting a complete month, except Ramadan. He (narrator) said: I then went to Ibn Abbas and narrated to him the hadith (transmitted from her), and he said: She says the truth. If I went to her and were admitted into her presence, I should have listened to it orally from her.  He said: If I had known that you did not go to her, I should not have transmitted this hadith to you, narrated by her.

I prayed with the Apostle of Allah (peace be upon him) one night and he started reciting al-Baqarah.

He then started an-Nisa', and recited it; then he started Aal-i-Imran and recited leisurely. When he recited the verse which referred to the Glory of Allah, he glorified (by saying SubhanAllah--Glory to my Lord the Great). When he recited the verses which tell (how the Lord) is to be supplicated , he (the Holy Prophet) would then supplicate (Him).  When he recited the verses dealing with the protection of the Lord, he sought (His protection) and would then bow and say: Glory be to my Mighty Lord. His bowing lasted about the same length of time as his standing (and then on returning to the standing posture after ruku) he would say: Allah listens to him who praises Him, and he would then stand about the same length of time as he had spent in bowing.  He would then prostrate himself and say: Glory be to my Lord most High, and his prostration lasted nearly the same length of time as his standing.

Upon this he said: Does not one of you go out in the morning to the mosque and teach or recite two verses from the Book of Allah, the Majestic and Glorious? That is better for him than two she-camels, and three verses are better (than three she-camels) and four verses are better for him than four (she-camels), and so on their number in camels.

AbuUmamah heard Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him) say: Recite the Qur'an, for on the Day of Resurrection it will come as an intercessor for those who recite it. Recite the two bright ones, al-Baqarah and Surah al-Imran, for on the Day of Resurrection they will come as two clouds or two shades, or two flocks of birds in ranks, pleading for those who recite them. Recite Surah al-Baqarah, for to take recourse to it is a blessing and to give it up is a cause of grief, and the magicians cannot confront it.

When we had finished the prayer, we all went to Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him) and I said to him: This man recited in a style to which I objected, and the other entered and recited in a style different from that of his companion.  The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) asked them to recite, so they recited. The Apostle (peace be upon him) expressed approval of their efforts (their modes of recitation), and there occurred in my mind a sort of denial which did not occur even during the Days of Ignorance. When the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) saw how I was affected (by a wrong idea), he struck my chest, whereupon I broke into a sweat and felt as though I were looking at Allah in fear.  He (the Holy Prophet) said to me: Ubayy, a message was sent to me to recite the Qur'an in one dialect, and I replied: Make (things easy for my people.

.hadithNarrator Amr ibn Abasah Sulami
When I was in the state of Ignorance (before embracing Islam) I used to think that the people were in error; they were not on anything (that might be called the right path) and they worshipped idols. Meanwhile I heard of a man in Mecca who was giving news (on the basis of his prophetic knowledge); so I mounted and rode to him. The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) was at that time hiding as his people had made life hard for him. I adopted a friendly attitude (towards the Meccans and thus managed) to enter Mecca and go to him (the Holy Prophet).  I said to him: Who are you?  He said: I am a Prophet (of Allah).  I again said: What is a Prophet?  He said: (I am a Prophet in the sense that) I have been sent by Allah.  I said: What have you been sent to do?  He said: I have been sent to join ties of relationship (with kindness and affection), to break the idols, and to proclaim the oneness of Allah (in a manner that) nothing is to be associated with Him.  I said: Who is with you in this (in these beliefs and practices)? He said: A free man and a slave.  He (the narrator) said: AbuBakr and Bilal were there with him among those who had embraced Islam by that time.  I said: It intend to follow you.  He said: During these days you will not be able to do so. Don't you see the (hard) conditions under which I and (my) people are living? You had better go back to your people and when you hear that I have been granted victory, you come to me.  So I went to my family. I was in my home when the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) came to Medina. I was among my people and used to seek news and ask people when he arrived in Medina. Then a group of people belonging to Yathrib (Medina) came.  I said (to them): How is that person, who has come to Medina, faring?  They said: The people are hastening to him, while his people (the polytheists of Mecca) planned to kill him but they could not do so.  I (on hearing it) came to Medina and went to him and said: Messenger of Allah, do you recognize me?  He said: Yes, you are the same man who met me at Mecca.  I said: It is so.  I again said: Prophet of Allah, tell me that which Allah has taught you and which I do not know, tell me about the prayer.  He said: Observe the dawn prayer, then stop praying when the sun is rising until it is fully ,risen for when it rises it comes up between the horns of Satan, and the unbelievers prostrate themselves to it at that time. Then pray, for the prayer is witnessed and attended (by angels) until the shadow becomes about the length of a lance; then cease prayer, for at that time Hell is heated up. Then when the shadow moves forward, pray, for the prayer is witnessed and attended by angels, until you pray the afternoon prayer. Then cease prayer until the sun sets, for it sets between the horns of the Devil, and at that time the unbelievers prostrate themselves before it.  I said: Apostle of Allah, tell me about ablution also.  He said: He who uses water for ablution, rinses his mouth, snuffs up water and blows it out, the sins of his face, his mouth and his nostrils will be washed away. When he washes his face, as Allah has commanded him, the sins of his face are carried away from the end of his beard with the water. Then (when) he washes his forearms up to the elbows, the sins of his arms are carried away with the water from his finger-tips. When he wipes his head, the sins of his head are carried away from the ends of his hair with the water. And (when) he washes his feet up to the ankles, the sins of his feet are carried away from his toes with the water. And if he stands to pray and praises Allah, lauds Him, glorifies Him with what becomes Him and shows wholehearted devotion to Allah, his sins will depart, leaving him (as innocent) as he was on the day his mother bore him.  Amr ibn Abasah narrated this hadith to AbuUmamah, a companion of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him), and AbuUmamah said to him: Amr ibn Abasah, think of what you are saying; that such (a great reward) is given to a man in one place (only in the act of ablution and prayer).  Upon this Amr said: AbuUmamah, I have grown old my bones have become weak and I am at death's door; what reason is there for me to attribute a lie to Allah and the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him)? Had I heard it from the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) once, twice, or three times (even seven times), I should have never narrated it, but I have heard it from him on more occasions than these.

As he entered (the apartment) he sent for me and said: Do not repeat what you have done. Whenever you have observed the Jumu'ah prayer, do not observe (sunnah prayer) till you have talked or got out for the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) had ordered us to do this and not to combine two (types of) prayers without talking or going out.

There was a solar eclipse in the time of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him). He stood up to pray and remained standing for a very long time.

He praised Allah, lauded Him and said: The sun and the moon are two signs of Allah; they are not eclipsed on account of anyone's death or on account of anyone's birth. So when you see them, glorify and supplicate Allah, observe prayer, give alms. O Ummah of Muhammad, none is more indignant than Allah when His servant or maid commits fornication.

There was an eclipse of the sun during the lifetime of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him). So the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) went to the mosque, stood up and glorified Allah, and the people formed themselves in rows behind him.  The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) made a long recital (of the Qur'an), pronounced takbir and then observed a long ruku'.  He then raised his head and said: Allah listens to him who praises Him: our Lord, praise is due to Thee. He then again stood up and made a long recital, which was less than the first recital. He pronounced takbir and observed a long ruku', which was less than the first one.  He again said: Allah listens to him who praises Him; our Lord, praise is due to Thee. (AbuTahir, one of the narrators, made no mention of: "He then prostrated himself.") He did the same for the second rak'ah, until he had completed four rak'ahs and four prostrations, and the sun had become bright before he departed.  He then stood up and addressed the people. After lauding Allah as He deserved, he said: The sun and the death of anyone or on his birth. So when you see them, hasten to prayer. He also said this: Observe prayer until Allah dispels the anxiety (of this extraordinary phenomenon) from you. The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said: I saw in my place everything which you have been promised. I even saw myself desiring to pluck a bunch (of grapes) from Paradise (and it was at the time) when you saw me moving forward. And I saw Hell and some of its parts crushing the others, when you saw me moving back; and I saw in it Ibn Luhayy and he was the person who made the she-camels loiter about.

The sun was eclipsed during the lifetime of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) on the very day when Ibrahim (the Prophet's son) died. The Apostle of Allah (peace be upon him) stood up and led the people in (two rak'ahs of) prayer with six ruku's and four prostrations.  He commenced (the prayer) with takbir (AllahuAkbar) then recited and prolonged his recital. He then bowed for nearly the (length of time) that he had been standing. He then raised his head from the ruku' and recited, but less than the first recital. He then bowed (for the same length of time) that he had been standing. He then raised his head from the ruku and again recited, but less than the second recital. He then bowed (for the same length of time) that he had been standing. He then lifted his head from the ruku'. He then went down in prostration and observed two prostrations. He stood up and then bowed, observing six ruku's in the same way, without (completing) the rak'ah in them, except (this difference) that the first (qiyam of ruku') was longer than the later one and the ruku' was nearly (of the same length) as the prostration.  He then moved backward and the rows behind him also moved backward until we reached the wall (AbuBakr said: until he reached the women.) He then moved forward and the people also moved forward with him until he stood at his (original) place (of worship). He then completed the prayer in the required manner.  The sun brightened and he said: O people! Verily the sun and the moon are among the signs of Allah and they do not eclipse each other at the death of any of the people. (AbuBakr said: On the death of any human being.) So when you see anything like it (of the nature of an eclipse), pray until it is bright.  There is nothing that you have been promised (in the next world) but I have seen it in this prayer of mine. Hell was brought to me: you saw me moving back on account of fear lest its heat might affect me. I saw the owner of the curved staff, who dragged his intestines in the fire, and he used to steal (the belongings) of the pilgrims with his curved staff. If he (the owner of the staff) became aware of it, he would say: It became (accidentally) entangled in my curved staff; but if he was unaware of it, he would take that away. I also saw in it (in Hell) the owner of a cat whom she had tied up, neither feeding nor letting her go free so that she could eat the creatures of the Earth, until the cat died of starvation.  Paradise was brought to me, and it was on that occasion that you saw me moving forward till I stood at my place (of worship). I stretched my hand as I wanted to catch hold of its fruits so that you might see them. Then I thought should not do it. That which you have been promised was there, and I saw it in this prayer of mine.

(He will find) that not a single young one is missing, and they will trample him with their hoofs and bite him with their mouths. As often as the first of them passes him, the last of them will be made to return for a day, the extent of which will be fifty thousand years, until judgment is pronounced upon the servants and he sees whether his path is to take him to Paradise or to Hell. It was (again) said: Messenger of Allah, what about cows (cattle) and sheep?  He said: If any owner of the cattle and sheep does not pay what is due on them, when the Day of Resurrection comes, a soft sandy plain will be spread for them. He will find none of them missing, with twisted horns, without horns or with a broken horn, and they will gore him with their horns and trample him with their hoofs. As often as the first of them passes him the last of them will be made to return to him for a day, the extent of which will be fifty thousand years, until judgment is pronounced upon the servants. And he would be shown his Path leading him to Paradise or to Hell. It was said: Messenger of Allah, what about the horse?  Upon this he said: The horses are of three types. To one man (these are) burden, and to another man (these are) a covering, and still to another man (these are) a source of reward. The one to whom these are a burden is the person who rears them in order to show off, for vainglory and for opposing the Muslims; so they are a burden to him. The one for whom these are a covering is the person who rears them for the sake of Allah but does not forget the right of Allah concerning their backs and their necks, and so they are a covering for him. As for those which bring reward (these refer to) the person who rears them for the sake of Allah, to be used for Muslims, so he puts them in meadows and fields. And whatever they eat from those meadows and fields will be recorded on his behalf as good deeds, as will also the amount of their dung and urine. They will not break their halters and prance a course or two without having recorded the amount of their hoof marks and their dung as a good deed on his behalf (on behalf of their owner). And their master does not bring them past a river from which they drink, though he did not intend to quench their thirst, but Allah will record for him the amount of what they drink on his behalf as good deeds. It was said: Messenger of Allah, what about the asses?  Upon this he said: Nothing has been revealed to me in regard to the asses (in particular) except this one verse of a comprehensive nature: "He who does an atom weight of good will see it, and he who does an atom weight of evil will see it" (xcix.7).

Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him) said: The owner of a camel, who does not pay what is due on it (will be punished in this way): on the Day of Resurrection many more camels (together with his camel) will come. The owner will be made to sit on soft sandy ground and they will trample him with their hooves. No owner of cattle who does not pay what is due on them (will be spared the punishment). On the Day of Resurrection, many more cattle will come; he (the owner) will be made to sit on soft sandy ground, and will be gored by their horns and trampled under their feet. No owner of goats and sheep, who does not pay what is due on them (will be spared the punishment) many more goats and sheep will come on the Day of Resurrection; he (the owner) will be made to sit on soft sandy ground which they gore him with their horns and trample him under their hooves. And there will be more (among this flock of sheep and goats) without horns, or with broken horns. No owner of treasure, who does not pay its due will escape punishment. His treasure will come on the Day of Resurrection, looking like a bald snake. It will  pursue him with its mouth open, and when it comes near he will be called thus: "I take your treasure which you concealed, for I do not need it." When he finds no way out he will put his hand in its mouth and it will gnaw it like a bull-camel. AbuzZubayr said: We heard Ubayd ibn Umayr saying this. We then asked Jabir ibn Abdullah about it. He also said the same as Ubayd ibn Umayr. AbuzZubayr said: I heard Ubayd ibn Umayr saying: A man said: Messenger of Allah, what is due on camels?  He said: Milking them near water, lending the bucket (used for drawing water for it), or lending the bull-camel for mating with a she-camel and providing it as a mount for the sake of Allah.

While we were in the company of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) in the early hours of the morning, some people came there (who) were barefoot, naked, wearing only striped woollen clothes, or cloaks, with their swords hung (around their necks). Most of them, nay all of them, belonged to the tribe of Mudar.  The colour of the face of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) underwent a change when he saw them in poverty. He then entered (his house) and came out and commanded Bilal (to pronounce Adhan). He pronounced Adhan and Iqamah, and he (the Holy Prophet) observed prayer (along with his companions) and then addressed (them, reciting verses of the Holy Qur'an): "O people, fear your Lord, Who created you from a single being" to the end of the verse, "Allah is ever a Watcher over you" (iv.1). (He then recited) a verse of Surah al-Hashr: "Fear Allah, and let every soul consider that which it sends forth for the morrow and fear Allah" (lix.18).  (Then the audience began to vie with one another in giving charity.) Some donated a dinar, others a dirham, still others clothes, some donated a sa' of wheat, some a sa' of dates; until he (the Holy Prophet) said: (Bring) even if it is half a date. Then one of the Ansar came there with a money bag which his hands could scarcely lift; in fact, they could not (lift it). Then the people followed continually, until I saw two heaps of eatables and clothes, and I saw the face of the Messenger (peace be upon him) glistening like gold (on account of joy).  The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said: He who sets a good precedent in Islam, there is a reward for him for this (act of goodness) and reward of those also who acted according to it subsequently, without any deduction from their rewards.

It was there in Syria that the month of Ramadan commenced. I saw the new moon (of Ramadan) on Friday. I then came back to Medina at the end of the month.  Abdullah ibn Abbas asked me (about the new moon of Ramadan) and said: When did you see it?  I said: We saw it on Friday night.  He said: (Did) you see it yourself?

So we shall continue to observe the fast until we complete thirty (fasts) or we see it (the new moon of Shawwal).  I said: Is the sighting of the moon by Mu'awiyah not valid for you?

Duba'ah bint az-Zubayr ibn AbdulMuttalib came to Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him) and said: I am an ailing woman but I intend to perform Hajj; what you command me (to do)? He (the Prophet) said: Enter into the state of Ihram (uttering these words) of condition: I would be free from it when Thou wouldst detain me. He (the narrator) said: But she was able to complete (the Hajj without breaking down).

The Messenger of Allah came out on the 4th or 5th of Dhul-Hijjah (for Pilgrimage to Mecca) and came to me, and he was very angry. I said: Messenger of Allah, who had annoyed you? May Allah cast him in fire! He said: Don't you know that I commanded the people to do an act, but they are hesitant. (Hakam said: I think that he said: They seem to be hesitant.) And if I were to know my affair before what I had to do subsequently, I would not have brought with me the sacrificial animals, and would have bought them (at Mecca) and would have put off Ihram as others have done.

We, in the state of Ihram, came with the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) for Hajj Mufrad (with the aim of Hajj only), and Aisha set out for Umrah, and when we reached Sarif, she (Aisha) entered in the state of monthly period; we proceeded on till we reached (Mecca) and circumambulated the Ka'bah and ran between (as-Safa) and al-Marwah; and the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) commanded that one who amongst us had not sacrificial animal with him should put off Ihram. We said: What does this "putting off" imply. He said: Getting out completely from the state of Ihram, (so we put off Ihram), and we turned to our wives and applied perfume and put on our clothes, and we were at a four night's distance from Arafat. And we again put on Ihram on the day of Tarwiyah (8th of Dhul-Hijjah). The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) came to Aisha and found her weeping, and said: What is the matter with you? She said: The matter is that I have entered in the monthly period, and the people had put off Ihram, but I did not and I did not circumambulate the House, and the people are going for Hajj now (but I can't go), whereupon he said: It is the matter which Allah has ordained for the daughters of Adam, so now take a bath and put on Ihram for Hajj. She (Aisha) did accordingly, and stayed at the places of staying till the monthly period was over. She then circumambulated the House, and (ran between) as-Safa' and al-Marwah. He (the Holy Prophet) then said: Now both your Hajj and Umrah are complete, whereupon she said: I feel in my mind that I did not circumambulated the House till I performed Hajj (I missed the circumambulation of Umrah). Thereupon he (Allah's Apostle) said: AbdurRahman, take her to Tan'im (so as to enable her) to perform Umrah (separately), and it was the night at Hasbah.

AbuNadrah reported: Ibn Abbas commanded the performance of Mut'ah (putting on Ihram for Umrah during the months of Dhul-Hijjah and after completing it, then putting on Ihram for Hajj), but Ibn Zubayr forbade to do it. I made a mention of it to Jabir ibn Abdullah and he said: It is through me that this hadith has been circulated. We entered into the state of Ihram as Tamattu' with the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him). When Umar was installed as Caliph, he said: Verily Allah made permissible for His Messenger (peace be upon him) whatever He liked and as He liked. And (every command) of the Holy Qur'an has been revealed for every occasion. So accomplish Hajj and Umrah for Allah as Allah has commanded you, and confirm by (proper conditions) the marriage of those women (with whom you have performed Mut'ah) And any person would come to me with a marriage of appointed duration (Mut'ah), I would stone him (to death). Qatadah narrated this hadith with the same chain of transmitters saying (That Umar also said): Separate your Hajj from Umrah , for that is the most complete Hajj, and complete your Umrah.

.hadithNarrator Jabir ibn Abdullah
Ja'far ibn Muhammad reported on the authority of his father: We went to Jabir ibn Abdullah and he began inquiring about the people (who had gone to see him) till it was my turn. I said: I am Muhammad ibn Ali ibn Husayn. He placed his hand upon my head and opened my upper button and then the lower one and then placed his palm on my chest (in order to bless me), and I was, during those days, a young boy, and he said: You are welcome, my nephew. Ask whatever you want to ask. And I asked him but as he was blind (he could not respond to me immediately), and the time for prayer came. He stood up covering himself in his mantle. And whenever he placed its ends upon his shoulders they slipped down on account of being short (in size). Another mantle was, however, lying on the clothes rack near by and he led us in the prayer.  I said to him: Tell me about the Hajj of Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him) stayed in (Medina) for nine years but did not perform Hajj, then he made a public announcement in the tenth year to the effect that Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him) was about to perform the Hajj. A large number of persons came to Medina and all of them were anxious to follow the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) and do according to his doing. We set out with him till we reached Dhul-Hulayfah. Asma daughter of Umays gave birth to Muhammad ibn AbuBakr. She sent message to the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) asking him: What should I do? He (the Holy Prophet) said: Take a bath, bandage your private parts and put on Ihram. The Messenger of Allah (may peace be Upon him) then prayed in the mosque and then mounted al-Qaswa (his she-camel) and it stood erect with him on its back at al-Bayda'.  And I saw as far as I could see in front of me but riders and pedestrians, and also on my right and on my left and behind me like this. And the Messenger of Allah (may peace be him) was prominent among us and the (revelation) of the Holy Qur'an was descending upon him. And it is he who knows (its true) significance. And whatever he did, we also did that. He pronounced the Oneness of Allah (saying): "Labbayk, O Allah, Labbayk, Labbayk, Thou hast no partner, praise and grace is Thine and the Sovereignty too; Thou hast no partner." And the people also pronounced this Talbiyah which they pronounce (today). The Messenger of Allah (my peace be upon him) did not reject anything out of it. But the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) adhered to his own Talbiyah.  Jabir said: We did not have any other intention but that of Hajj only, being unaware of the Umrah (at that season), but when we came with him to the House, he touched the pillar, and (made seven circuits) running three of them and walking four. And then going to the Station of Ibrahim, he rejected: "And adopt the Station of Ibrahim as a place of prayer." And this Station was between him and the House. My father said (and I do not know whether he had made a mention of it but that was from Allah's Apostle (peace be upon him) that he recited in two rak'ahs: "say: He is Allah One, " and say: "Say : O unbelievers." He then returned to the pillar (Hajar Aswad) and kissed it. He then went out of the gate to as-Safa and as he reached near it he recited: "As-Safa and al-Marwah are among the signs appointed by Allah, (adding:) I begin with what Allah (has commanded me) to begin. He first mounted as-Safa' till he saw the House, and facing Qiblah he declared the Oneness of Allah and glorified Him, and said: "There is no god but Allah, One, there is no partner with Him. His is the Sovereignty, to Him praise is due, and He is Powerful over everything. There is no god but Allah alone, Who fulfilled His promise, helped His servant and routed the confederates alone." He then made supplication in the course of that saying such words three times. He then descended and walked towards al-Marwah, and when his feet came down in the bottom of the valley, he ran, and when he began to ascend he walked till he reached al-Marwah. There he did as he had done at as-Safa.  And when it was his last running at al-Marwah he said: If I had know beforehand what I have come to know afterwards, I would not have brought sacrificial animals and would have performed an Umrah. So, he who among you has not the sacrificial animals with him should put off Ihram and treat it as an Umrah. Suraqah ibn Malik ibn Ju'sham got up and said: Messenger of Allah, does it apply to the present year, or does it apply for ever? Thereupon the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) intertwined the fingers (of one hand) into another and said twice: The `Umrah has become incorporated in the Hajj (adding): "No, but for ever and ever."  Ali came from the Yemen with the sacrificial animals for the Prophet (peace be upon him) and found Fatimah (Allah be pleased with her) to be one among those who had put off Ihram and had put on dyed clothes and had applied antimony. He (Ali) showed disapproval to it, whereupon she said: My father has commanded me to do this. (The narrator) said that Ali said that Ali used to say in Iraq: I went to the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) showing annoyance at Fatimah for what she had done, and asked the (verdict) of Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him) regarding what she had narrated from him, and told him that I was angry with her, whereupon` he said: She has told the truth, she has told the truth.  (The Holy Prophet then asked Ali): What did you say when you undertook to go for Hajj? I (Ali) said: O Allah, I am putting on Ihram for the same purpose as Thy Messenger has put it on. He said: I have with me sacrificial animals, so do not put off the Ihram. He (Jabir) said: The total number of those sacrificial animals brought by Ali from the Yemen and of those brought by the Apostle (peace be upon him) was one hundred. Then all the people except the Apostle (peace be upon him) and those who had with them sacrificial animals, put off Ihram, and got their hair clipped; when it was the day of Tarwiyah (8th of Dhul-Hijjah) they went to Mina and put on the Ihram for Hajj and the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) rode and led the noon, afternoon, sunset Isha' and dawn prayers. He then waited a little till the sun rose, and commanded that a tent of hair should be pitched at Namirah.

The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) then set out and the Quraysh did not doubt that he would halt at al-Mash'ar al-Haram (the sacred site) as the Quraysh used to do in the pre-Islamic period. The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him), however, passed on till he came to Arafat and he found that the tent had been pitched for him at Namirah. There he got down till the sun had passed the meridian; he commanded that al-Qaswa should be brought and saddled for him.  Then he came to the bottom of the valley, and addressed the people saying: Verily your blood, your property are as sacred and inviolable as the sacredness of this day of yours, in this month of yours, in this town of yours, Behold! Everything pertaining to the Days of Ignorance is under my feet completely abolished. Abolished are also the blood-revenges of the Days of Ignorance. The first claim of ours on blood-revenge which I abolish is that of the son of Rabi'ah ibn al-Harith, who was nursed among the tribe of Sa'd and killed by Hudhayl. And the usury of she pre-Islamic period is abolished, and the first of our usury I abolished is that of Abbas ibn AbdulMuttalib, for it is all abolished.  Fear Allah concerning women! Verily you have taken them on the security of Allah, and intercourse with them has been made lawful unto you by words of Allah. You too have right over them, and that they should not allow anyone to sit on your bed whom you do not like. But if they do that, you can chastise them but not severely. Their right upon you are that you should provide them with food and clothing in a fitting manner. I have left among you the Book of Allah, and if you hold fast to it, you would never go astray.  And you would be asked about me (on the Day of Resurrection), (now tell me) what would you say? They (the audience) said: We will bear witness that you have conveyed (the message), discharged (the ministry of Prophethood) and given wise (sincere) counsel. He (the narrator) said: He (the Holy Prophet) then raised his forefinger towards the sky and pointing it at the people (said): "O Allah, be witness. O Allah be witness," saying it thrice (Bilal then) pronounced Adhan and later on Iqamah and he (the Holy Prophet) led the noon prayer. He (Bilal) then uttered Iqamah and he (the Holy Prophet) led the afternoon prayer and he observed no other prayer in between the two.  The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) then mounted his camel and came to the place of stay, making his she-camel al-Qaswa turn towards the side where there were rocks, having the path taken by those who went on foot in front of him, and faced the Qiblah. He kept standing there till the sun set, and the yellow light had somewhat gone, and the disc of the sun had disappeared. He made Usamah sit behind him, and he pulled the nose-string of Qaswa so forcefully that its head touched the saddle (in order to keep her under perfect control), and he pointed out to the people with his right hand to be moderate (in speed), and whenever he happened to pass over in elevated tract of sand, he slightly loosened it (the nose-string of his camel) till she climbed up and this is how he reached al-Muzdalifah.  There he led the evening and Isha prayers with one Adhan and two Iqamahs and did not glorify (Allah) in between them (i.e. he did not observe supererogatory rak'ahs between Maghrib and Isha prayers). The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) then lay down till dawn and offered the dawn prayer with an Adhan and Iqamah when the morning light was clear. He again mounted al-Qaswa, and when he came to al-Mash'ar al-Haram, he faced towards Qiblah, supplicated Him, Glorified Him, and pronounced His Uniqueness (La ilaha illallah) and Oneness, and kept standing till the daylight was very clear.  He then went quickly before the sun rose, and seated behind him was al-Fadl ibn Abbas, and he was a man having beautiful hair and fair complexion and handsome face. As the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) was moving on, there was also going a group of women (side with them). Al-Fadl began to look at them. The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) placed his hand on the face of Fadl who then turned his face to the other side, and began to see, and the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) turned his hand to the other side and placed it on the face of al-Fadl. He again turned his face to the other side till he came to the bottom of Muhassir. He urged her (al-Qaswa) a little, and, following the middle road, which comes out at the greatest Jamrah, he came to the Jamrah which is near the tree. At this he threw seven small pebbles, saying AllahuAkbar while throwing every one of them in manner in which the small pebbles are thrown (with the help of fingers) and this he did in the bottom of the valley.  He then went to the place of sacrifice, and sacrificed sixty-three (camels) with his won hand. Then he gave the remaining number to Ali who sacrificed them, and he shared him in his sacrifice. He then commanded that a piece of flesh from each animal sacrificed should be put in a pot, and when it was cooked, both of them (the Holy Prophet and Ali) took some meat out of it and drank its soup. The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him again rode and came to the House, and offered the Zuhr prayer at Mecca. He came to the tribe of AbdulMuttalib, who were supplying water at Zamzam, and said: Draw water, O Banu AbdulMuttalib; were it not that people would usurp this right of supplying water from you, I would have drawn it along with you. So they handed him a basket and he drank from it.

Ibn Abbas narrated from al-Fadl ibn Abbas who sat behind Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him) that he (the Holy Prophet) told the people on the evening of Arafah and in the morning to the gathering of people (at Muzdalifah) as they were pushing on to proceed slowly. And he himself rode his she-camel with restraint until he entered Muhassir (a place in Mina), and further told them to pick up pebbles which were to be thrown at Jamrah. And Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him) continued pronouncing Talbiyah till he stoned the Jamrah.  This hadith has been narrated on the authority of AbuzZubayr with the same chain of transmitters but with this variation that in the hadith no mention is made of (this) that Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him) continued pronouncing Talbiyah till he stoned the Jamrah, and he made this addition in his hadith: "The Apostle (peace be upon him) showed with his hand how a person should catch hold of pebbles (in order to throw them)."

Mu'awiyah ordered someone to sell it to pay the people (soldiers). The people hurried to receive it.  The news of (this state of affairs) reached Ubadah ibn as-Samit, and he stood up and said: I heard Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him) forbidding the sale of gold for gold, and silver for silver, wheat for wheat, barley for barley, dates for dates, and salt for salt, except like for like and equal for equal. So he who made an addition or who accepted an addition (committed the sin of taking) interest. So the people returned what they had received.  This reached Mu'awiyah, and he stood up to deliver an address. He said: What is the matter with people that they narrate from the Messenger (peace be upon him) such traditions which we did not hear though we saw him (the Holy Prophet) and lived in his company? Thereupon Ubadah ibn as-Samit stood up and repeated that narration, and then said: We definitely narrate what we heard from Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him) even though it may be unpleasant for Mu'awiyah (or he said: Even if it is against his will).

Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him) came to him and he was tied with ropes. He said: Muhammad.  He came up to him and said: What is the matter with you?  Thereupon he (the prisoner) said: Why have you taken me as prisoner and why have you caught hold of one preceding the pilgrims (the she-camel as she carried the Holy Prophet on her back and walked ahead of the multitude)?  He (the Holy Prophet) said: (Yours is a great fault). I (my men) have captured of you for the crime of your allies, Banu Thaqif. He (the Holy Prophet) then turned away. He again called him and said: Muhammad, Muhammad, and since Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him) was very compassionate and tenderhearted, he returned to him, and said: What is the matter with you?  He said: I am a Muslim.  Thereupon he (the Holy Prophet) said: Had you said this when you had been the master of yourself, you would have gained every success. He then turned away.

He (the Holy Prophet) said: That is (to satisfy) your want. He was then ransomed for two people (who had been taken prisoner by Thaqif). He (the narrator) said: A woman of the Ansar had been taken prisoner and also al-Abda' was caught. The woman had been tied with ropes. The people were resting to their animals in front of their houses. She escaped one night from the bondage and came to the camels. As she drew near the camels, they fretted and became angry and so she left them alone until she came to al-Adba'. It did not fret and fume; it was docile. She mounted upon its back and rode away. Thus she escaped. When they (the enemies of Islam) were warned of this, they went in search of it, but it (the she-camel) exhausted them. She (the woman) made vow to Allah that He saved her through it, she would offer that as a sacrifice.  As she reached Medina, the people saw her and they said: Here is al-Adba', the she-camel of Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him). She (the woman) said that she had taken a vow that if Allah would save her on its back, she would sacrifice it. They (the Prophet's companions) came to Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him) and mentioned that to him. Thereupon he said: Hallowed be Allah, how ill she rewarded it by vowing to Allah that if He saved her on its back, she would sacrifice it! There is no fulfilment of the vow in an act of disobedience, nor in an act over which a person has no control. In the version of Ibn Hujr (the words are): "There is no vow in disobedience to Allah."

He said: I do not possess any property but this robe of mine and this axe of mine.  He (the Holy Prophet) said: Do you think your people will pay ransom for you?  He said: I am more insignificant among my people than this (that I would not be able to obtain this benefit from my tribe).  He (the Holy Prophet) threw the strap towards him (the claimant of the blood-money) saying: Take away your man.  The man took him away, and as he returned, Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him) said: If he kills him, he will be like him.  He returned and said: Allah's Messenger, it has reached me that you said that "If he killed him, he would be like him." I caught hold of him according to your command.  Thereupon Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him) said: Don't you want him to take upon himself (the burden) of your sin and the sin of your companion (your brother)?  He said: Allah's Apostle, why not? The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said: If it is so, then let it be. He threw away the strap (around the offender) and set him free.

A woman struck her co-wife with a tent-pole and she was pregnant and she killed her. One of them belonged to the tribe of Lihyan. Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him) made the relatives of the murderer responsible for the payment of blood-wit on her behalf, and fixed a slave or a female slave as the indemnity for what was in her womb. One of the persons amongst the relatives of the murderer said: Should we pay indemnity for one who neither ate, nor drank, nor made any noise, who was just like a nonentity? Thereupon Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him) remarked: He speaks rhymed phrases like the people of the desert. He did impose indemnity upon them.

A person belonging to the clan of Aslam, who was called Ma'iz ibn Malik, came to Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him) and said: I have committed an immoral crime (adultery), so inflict punishment upon me. Allah's Apostle (peace be upon him) turned him away again and again. He then asked his people (about the state of his mind).  They said: We do not know of any ailment of his except that he has committed some crime and he thinks that he will not be able to relieve himself of its burden unless the Hadd is imposed upon him.  He (Ma'iz) came back to Allah's Apostle (peace be upon him) who commanded us to stone him. We took him to the Baqi' al-Gharqad (the graveyard of Medina). We neither tied him nor dug any ditch for him. We attacked him with bones, clods and pebbles. He ran away and we ran after him until he reached the stony ground (al-Harrah) and stopped there and we stoned him with the heavy stones of the Harrah until he became motionless (he died).  He (the Holy Prophet) then addressed (us) in the evening saying: Whenever we set forth on an expedition in the cause of Allah, some of those connected with us shrieked (under the pressure of sexual lust) like the bleating of a billy-goat.

Ma'iz ibn Malik came to Allah's Apostle (peace be upon him) and said to him: Messenger of Allah, purify me. Thereupon he said: Woe to you, go back, ask forgiveness of Allah and turn to Him in repentance. He (the narrator) said that he went off a little way, then came and said: Messenger of Allah purify me. The Messenger of Allah said: Woe be upon you, go back and ask forgiveness of Allah and turn to Him in repentance. He (the narrator) said that he went off a little way, then he came and said: Allah's Messenger, purify me. Allah's Apostle (peace be upon him) said as he had said before.  When it was the fourth time, Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him) said: From what am I to purify you?  He said: From adultery. Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him) asked if he had been mad. He was informed that he was not mad.  He said: Has he drunk wine? someone stood up and smelt his breath but noticed no smell of wine. Thereupon Allah's Messenger (may peace) be upon him) said: Have you committed adultery?  He said: Yes. He made a pronouncement about him and he was stoned to death.  The people had been (divided) into two groups about him (Ma'iz). One of them said: He has been undone for his sins have encompassed him, whereas another said: There is no repentance more excellent than the repentance of Ma'iz, for he came to Allah's Apostle (peace be upon him) and placing his hand in his (in the Holy Prophet's) hand said: Kill me with stones. (This controversy about Ma'is) remained for two or three days. Then came Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him) to them (his companions) as they were sitting.  He greeted them with a salutation and then sat down and said: Ask forgiveness for Ma'iz ibn Malik.  They said: May Allah forgive Ma'iz ibn Malik.  Thereupon Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him) said: He (Ma'iz) has made such a repentance that if that were to be divided among a people, it would have been enough for all of them. He (the narrator) said: Then a woman of Ghamid, a branch of Azd, came to him and said: Messenger of Allah, purify me.  Thereupon he said: Woe to you; go back and beg forgiveness from Allah and turn to Him in repentance.  She said: I find that you intend to send me back as you sent back Ma'iz ibn Malik.  He (the Holy Prophet) said: What has happened to you? She said that she had become pregnant as a result of fornication. He (the Holy Prophet) said: Is it you (who has done that)?  She said: Yes.  He (the Holy Prophet) said to her: (You will not be punished) until you give birth to that which is there in your womb. One of the Ansar became responsible for her until she was delivered (of the child).  He (that Ansar) came to Allah's Apostle (peace be upon him) and said: The woman of Ghamid has given birth to a child.  He (the Holy Prophet) said: In that case we shall not stone her and so leave her infant with none to breast-feed him.

There happened to pass by Allah's Apostle (peace be upon him) a Jew blackened and lashed.  Allah's Apostle (peace be upon him) called them (the Jews) and said: Is this the punishment that you find in your Book (Torah) as a prescribed punishment for adultery?  They said: Yes.  He (the Holy Prophet) called one of the scholars amongst them and said: I ask you in the name of Allah Who sent down the Torah to Moses if that is the prescribed punishment for adultery, which you find in your Book.  He said: No. Had you not asked me in the name of Allah, I should not have given you this information. We find stoning to death (as the punishment prescribed in the Torah).  However, this (crime) became quite common amongst our aristocratic class. So when we caught hold of any rich person (indulging in this offence) we spared him, but when we caught hold of a helpless person we imposed the prescribed punishment upon him. We then said: Let us agree (on a punishment) which we can inflict upon both the rich and the poor. So we decided to blacken the face with coal and flog as a substitute punishment for stoning. Thereupon Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him) said: O Allah, I am the first to revive Thy command when they had cancelled it. He then gave the order and he (the offender) was stoned to death.  Allah, the Majestic and Glorious, sent down (this verse): "O Messenger, (the behaviour of) those who vie with one another in denying the truth should not grieve you..." up to "is vouchsafed unto you, accept it" (v.41).  It was said (by the Jews): Go to Muhammad; if he commands you to blacken the face and award flogging (as punishment for adultery), then accept it, but if he gives the verdict of stoning, then avoid it. It was (then) that Allah, the Majestic and Great, sent down (these verses:"...And they who do not judge in accordance with what Allah has revealed, are indeed deniers of the truth" (v.44); "And they who do not judge in accordance with what Allah has revealed--they, they indeed are the wrongdoers" (v.45); "And they who do not judge in accordance with what God has revealed--they are the iniquitous" (v.47).

When the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) appointed anyone as leader of an army or detachment he would especially exhort him to fear Allah and to be good to the Muslims who were with him.  He would say: Fight in the name of Allah and in the cause of Allah. Fight against those who do not believe in Allah. Wage a holy war: do not embezzle the spoils, do not break your pledge, do not mutilate (the dead) bodies and do not kill the children.  When you meet enemies who are polytheists, invite them to three courses of action. If they respond to any one of these, you also accept it and restrain yourself from doing them any harm. Invite them to (accept) Islam; if they respond to you, accept it from them and desist from fighting against them. Then invite them to migrate from their lands to the land of Muhajirs and inform them that, if they do so, they shall have all the privileges and obligations of the Muhajirs. If they refuse to migrate, tell them that they will have the status of Bedouin Muslims and will be subjected to the Commands of Allah like other Muslims, but they will not receive any share from the spoils of war or Fay' except when they actually fight with the Muslims (against the nonbelievers). If they refuse to accept Islam, demand from them the Jizyah. If they agree to pay, accept it from them and hold your hand. If they refuse to pay the tax, seek Allah's help and fight them.  When you lay siege to a fort and the besieged appeal to you for protection in the name of Allah and His Prophet, do not accord to them the guarantee of Allah and His Prophet, but accord to them your own guarantee and the guarantee of your companions. It is a lesser sin that the security given by you or your companions be disregarded than that the security granted in the name of Allah and His Prophet be violated. When you besiege a fort and the besieged want you to let them out in accordance with Allah's Command, do not let them come out in accordance with His Command, but do so at your (own) command, for you do not know whether or not you will be able to carry out Allah's behest with regard to them.

When the Companions gathered round him from all sides, the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) got down from his mule, picked up a handful of dust from the ground, threw it into their (enemy) faces and said: May these faces be deformed! There was no one among the enemy whose eyes were not filled with the dust from this handful. So they fled in retreat, so Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, defeated them, and the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) distributed their booty among the Muslims.

When (the news of) the advance of AbuSufyan (at the head of a force) reached him, the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) held consultations with his companions.  The narrator said: AbuBakr spoke (expressing his own views), but he (the Holy Prophet) did not pay heed to him. Then spoke Umar (expressing his views), but he (the Holy Prophet) did not pay heed to him (either).  Then Sa'd ibn Ubadah stood up and said: Messenger of Allah, you want us (to speak). By God in Whose control is my life, if you order us to plunge our horses into the sea, we should do so. If you order us to urge our horses to the most distant place such as Bark al-Ghimad, we should do so.  The narrator said: Now the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) called upon the people (for the encounter). So they set out and encamped at Badr. (Soon) the water-carriers of the Quraysh arrived. Among them was a black slave belonging to Banu al-Hajjaj. The companions of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) caught him and interrogated him about AbuSufyan and his companions.  He said: I know nothing about AbuSufyan, but AbuJahl, Utbah, Shaybah and Umayyah ibn Khalaf are there. When he said this, they beat him. Then he said: All right. I shall tell you about AbuSufyan. They stopped beating him and then asked him (again) about AbuSufyan.  He again said: I know nothing about AbuSufyan, but AbuJahl, Utbah, Shaybah and Umayyah ibn Khalaf are there. When he said this, they beat him in the same way.  The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) was standing in prayer.  When he saw this he finished his prayer and said: By Allah in Whose control is my life, you beat him when he is telling you the truth, and let him go when he tells you a lie.  The narrator said: Then the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said: This is the place where so and so will be killed. He placed his hand on the earth (saying) here and here. (And) none of them were struck down outside the place which the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) had indicated by placing his hand on the earth.

Abdullah ibn Rabah said: Many deputations came to Mu'awiyah. This was in the month of Ramadan. We would prepare food for one another. AbuHurayrah was one of those who frequently invited us to his house.  I said: Should I not prepare food and invite them to my house? So I ordered meals to be prepared. Then I met AbuHurayrah in the evening and said: (You will have) your meals with me tonight.  He said: You have forestalled me.  I said: Yes; and invited them. (When they had finished the meal) AbuHurayrah said: Should I not tell you one of your traditions, O ye assembly of the Ansar? He then gave an account of the Conquest of Mecca and said: The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) advanced until he reached Mecca. He deputed Zubayr on his right flank and Khalid on the left, and he despatched AbuUbaydah with the force that had no armour. They advanced to the interior of the valley. The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) was in the midst of a large contingent of fighters.  He saw me and said: AbuHurayrah.  I said: I am here at your call, Messenger of Allah!  He said: Let no one come to me except the Ansar, so call to me the Ansar (only). AbuHurayrah continued: So they gathered round him. The Quraysh also gathered their ruffians and their (lowly) followers, and said: We send these forward. If they obtain anything, we shall be with them (to share it), and if misfortune befalls them, we shall pay (as compensation) whatever we are asked for. The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said (to the Ansar): You see the ruffians and the (lowly) followers of the Quraysh. And he indicated by (striking) one of his hands over the other that they should be killed, and said: Meet me at as-Safa'. Then we went on (and) if any one of us wanted a certain person to be killed, he was killed, and none could offer any resistance. AbuHurayrah continued: Then came AbuSufyan and said: Messenger of Allah, the blood of the Quraysh has become very cheap. There will be no Quraysh from this day on.  Then he (the Holy Prophet) said: Whoever enters the house of AbuSufyan, will be safe.  Some of the Ansar whispered among themselves: (After all), love for his city and tenderness towards his relations have overpowered him. AbuHurayrah said: (At this moment) revelation came to the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him) and when he was going to receive the Revelation, we understood. When he was (actually) receiving it, none of us would dare raise his eyes to the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) until the revelation came to an end. When the revelation came to an end, the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said: O ye assembly of the Ansar! They said: Here we are at your disposal, Messenger of Allah. He said: You were saying that love for his city and tenderness towards his people have overpowered this man. They said: So it was. He said: No, never. I am a bondsman of God, and His Messenger. I migrated towards God and towards you. I shall live with you and die with you. So, they (the Ansar) turned towards him in tears and they were saying: By Allah, we said what we said because of our tenacious attachment to Allah and His Messenger. The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said: Surely, Allah and His Messenger testify to your assertions and accept your apology. The narrator continued: People turned to the house of AbuSufyan and people locked their doors. The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) proceeded until he approached the (Black) Stone. He kissed it and circumambulated the Ka'bah. He reached an idol by the side of the Ka'bah, which was worshipped by the people. The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) had a bow in his hand, and he was holding it from a corner. When he came near the idol, he began to pierce its eyes with the bow and (while doing so) was saying: Truth has been established and falsehood has perished. When he had finished the circumambulation, he came to Safa', ascended it to a height from where he could see the Ka'bah, raised his hands (in prayer) and began to praise Allah and prayed what he wanted to pray.

The Quraysh made peace with the Prophet (peace be upon him). Among them was Suhayl ibn Amr.  The Prophet (peace be upon him) said to Ali: Write "In the name of Allah, most Gracious and most Merciful." Suhayl said: As for "Bismillah", we do not know what is meant by "Bismillah-ir-Rahman-ir-Rahim" (In the name of Allah, most Gracious and most Merciful). But write what we understand, i.e. Bismika Allahumma (in thy name, O Allah).  Then the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: Write: "From Muhammad, the Messenger of Allah."  They said: If we knew that you were the Messenger of Allah, we should follow you. Therefore, write your name and the name of your father.  So the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him) said: Write "From Muhammad ibn Abdullah."  They laid the condition on the Prophet (peace be upon him) that anyone who joined them from the Muslims, the Meccans would not return him; and anyone who joined then (the Muslims) from them, the Muslims would send him back to them.  The companions said: Messenger of Allah, should we write this?  He said: Yes. One who goes away from us to join them--may Allah keep him away! And one who comes to join us from them (and is sent back)--Allah will provide him with relief and a way of escape.

A man said: If I had been alive at the time of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him), I should have fought by his side and should have striven hard for his causes.  Hudhayfah said: You might have done that (but you should not make a flourish of your enthusiasm).  I was with the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) on the night of the battle of Ahzab and we were gripped by a violent wind and severe cold.  The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said: Hark, the man who (goes reconnoitring and) brings me the news of the enemy shall be ranked with me on the Day of Judgment by Allah (the Glorious and Exalted). We all kept quiet and none of us responded to him. (Again) he said: Hark, a man who (goes reconnoitring and) brings me the news of the enemy shall be ranked with me on the Day of Judgment by Allah (the Glorious and Exalted). We kept quiet and none of us responded to him. He again said: Hark, a man who (goes reconnoitring and) brings me the news of the enemy shall be ranked with me on the Day of Judgment by Allah (the Glorious and Exalted). Then he said: Stand up, Hudhayfah, bring me the news of the enemy. When he called me by name, I had no alternative but to stand up.  He said: Go and bring me information about the enemy, and do nothing that may provoke them against me. When I left him, I felt warm as if I were walking in a heated bath, until I reached them. When I saw AbuSufyan warming his back against the fire, I put an arrow in the middle of the bow, intending to shoot at him, but I recalled the words of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him)--"Do not provoke them against me." Had I shot at him, I should have hit him. But I returned and (felt warm as if) I were walking in a heated bath (hammam). Presenting myself to him, I gave him information about the enemy. When I had done so, I began to feel cold, so the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) wrapped me in a blanket that he had surplus his own requirements and with which he used to cover himself while saying his prayers.

We arrived at Hudaybiyyah with the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) and we were fourteen hundred in number. There were fifty goats with us which could not be watered (by the small quantity of water in the local well). So, the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) sat on the brink of the well. Either he prayed or spat into the well. The water welled up. We drank and watered (the beasts as well). Then the Messenger of Allah (may peace be upon  him) called us to take the vow of allegiance, as he was sitting at the base of a tree. I was the first man to take the oath. Then other people took the oath. When half the number of people had done so, he said to me: You take the oath, Salamah. I said: I was one of those who took the vow in the first instance. He said: (you may do) again. Then the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) saw that I was without weapons. He gave me a big or a small shield. Then he continued to administer vows to the people until it was the last batch of them. He said (to me): Won't you swear allegiance, Salamah? I said: Messenger of Allah, I took the oath with the first batch of the people and then again when you were in the middle of the people. He said: (Doesn't matter), you may (do so) again. So I took the oath of allegiance thrice. Then he said to me: Salamah, where is the shield which I gave to thee? I said: Messenger of Allah,  my uncle Amir met me and he was without any weapons. So I gave the shield to him. The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) laughed and said: You are like a person of the days gone by who said: O God, I seek a friend who is dearer to me than myself. (When all Companions had sworn allegiance to the Holy Prophet), the polytheists sent messages of peace, until people could move from our camp to that of the Meccans and vice versa. Finally, the peace treaty was concluded. I was a dependant of Talhah bin Ubaydullah. I watered his horse and rubbed its back.  I served Talhah (doing odd jobs for him) and partook from his food. I had left my  family and my property as an emigrant in the cause of Allah and His Messenger (peace be upon him). When we and the people of Mecca had concluded a peace treaty  and the people of one side began to mix with those of the other, I came to a tree, swept away its thorns and lay down (for rest) at its base. (While I lay there), four of the polytheists from the Meccans came to me and began to talk ill of the Messenger of  Allah (peace be upon him). I got enraged with them and moved to another tree. They hung their weapons (to the branches of the trees) and lay down (for rest). (While they lay there), somebody from the lower part of the valley cried out: Run up, O Muhajirs! Ibn Zunaym has been murdered. I drew my sword and attacked these four while they were asleep. I seized their arms and collected them up in my hand, and said: By the Being Who has conferred honour upon Muhammad, none of you shall raise his head, else I will smite his face. (Then) I came driving them along to the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him). (At the same time), my uncle Amir came (to him) with a man from Abalat called Mikraz. Amir was dragging him on a horse with a thick covering on its back along with seventy polytheists. The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) cast a glance at them and said: Let them go (so that) they may prove guilty of breach of trust more than once (before we take action against them). So the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) forgave them. On this occasion, God revealed the Qur'anic verse: "It is He Who restrained their hands from you and your hands from them in the valley of Mecca after He has granted you a victory over them" (xiviii.24).  Then we started moving back to Medina, and halted at a place  where there was a mountain between us and Banu Libyan who were polytheists. The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) asked God's forgiveness for one who ascended the mountain at night to act as a scout for the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) and his Companions. I ascended (that mountain) twice or thrice that night.

(At last) we reached Medina. The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) sent his camels with his slave, Rabah, and I was with him. I (also) went to the pasture with the horse of Talhah along with the camels. When the day dawned, AbdurRahman al-Fazari made a raid and drove away all the camels of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him), and killed the man who looked after them. I said: Rabah, ride this horse, take it to Talhah ibn Ubaydullah and inform the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) that the polytheists have made away with his camels. Then I stood upon a hillock and turning my face to Medina, shouted thrice: Come to our help! Then I set out in pursuit of the raiders, shooting at them with arrows and chanting a (self-eulogising) verse in the Iambic meter:  I am the son of al-Akwa' And today is the day of defeat for the mean. I would overtake a man from them, shoot at him an arrow which, piercing through the saddle, would reach his shoulder, and I would say: Take it, chanting at the same time the verse: And I am the son of al-Akwa' And today is the day of defeat for the mean. By God, I continued shooting at them and hamstringing their animals. Whenever a horseman turned upon me, I would come to a tree and (hid myself) sitting at its base. Then I would shoot at him and hamstring his horse. (At last) they entered a narrow mountain gorge. I ascended that mountain and held them at bay throwing stones at them. I continued to chase them in this way until I got all the camels of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) released and no camel was left with them. They left me; then I followed them shooting at them (continually) until they dropped more than thirty mantles and thirty lances, lightening their burden. On everything they dropped, I put a mark with the help of (a piece of) stone so that the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) and his Companions might recognise them (that it was booty left by the enemy). (They went on) until they came to a narrow valley when so and so, son of Badr al-Fazari joined them. They (now), sat down to take their breakfast and I sat on the top of a tapering rock. Al-Fazari said: Who is that fellow I am seeing? They said: This fellow has harassed us. By God, he has not left us since dusk and has been (continually) shooting at us until he has snatched everything from our hands. He said: Four of you should make a dash at him (and kill him).  (Accordingly), four of them ascended the mountain coming towards me. When it became possible for me to talk to them, I said: Do you recognise me? They said: No. Who art thou? I said: I am Salamah, son of al-Akwa'. By the Being Who has honoured the countenance of Muhammad (peace be upon him) I can kill any of you I like but none of you will be able to kill me. One of them said: I think (he is right). So they returned. I did not move from my place until I saw the horsemen of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him), who came riding through the trees. Lo! the foremost among them was Akhram al-Asadi. Behind him was AbuQatadah al-Ansari and behind him was al-Miqdad bin al-Aswad al-Kindi.  I caught hold of the rein of Akhram's horse. (Seeing this), they (the raiders) fled. I said (to Akhram): Akhram, guard yourself against them until Allah's Messenger and his Companions join you. He said: O Salamah, if you believe in Allah and the Day of Judgment and (if) you know that Paradise is a reality and Hell is a reality, you should not stand between me and martyrdom. So I let him go. Akhram and AbdurRahman (Fazari) met in combat. Akhram hamstrung AbdurRahman's horse and the latter struck him with his lance and killed him. AbdurRahman turned about riding Akhram's horse. AbuQatadah, a horseman of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him), met AbdurRahman (in combat), smote him with his lance and killed him. By the Being Who honoured the countenance of Muhammad (peace be upon him), I followed them running on my feet (so fast) that I couldn't see behind me the Companions of Muhammad (peace be upon him), nor any dust raised by their horses. (I followed them) until before sunset they reached a valley which had a spring of water, which was called Dhu Qarad, so that they could have a drink, for they were thirsty. They saw me running towards them. I turned them out of the valley before they could drink a drop of its water. They left the valley and ran down a slope. I ran (behind them), overtook a man from them, shot him with an arrow through the shoulder blade and said: Take this. I am the son of al-Akwa';  And today is the day of annihilation for the people who are mean. The fellow (who was wounded) said: May his mother sweep over him! Are you the Akwa' who has been chasing us since morning? I said: Yes, O enemy of thyself, the same Akwa'. They left two horses dead tired on the hillock and I came dragging them along to the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him). I met Amir who had with him a container having milk diluted with water and a container having water. I performed ablution with the water and drank the milk.

Then I came to the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) while he was at (the spring of) water from which I had  driven them away. The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) had captured those camels and everything else I had captured and all the lances and mantles I had snatched from the polytheists; and Bilal had slaughtered a she-camel from the camels I had seized from the people, and was roasting its liver and hump for the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him).  I said: Messenger of Allah, let me select from our people one hundred men and I will follow the marauders and I will finish them all so that nobody is left to convey the news (of their destruction to their people). (At these words of mine), the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) laughed so much that his molar teeth could be seen in the light of the fire, and he said: Salamah, do you think you can do this? I said: Yes, by the Being Who has honoured you. He said: Now they have reached the land of Ghatafan where they are being feted. (At this time) a man from the Ghatafan came along and said: So and so slaughtered a camel for them. When they were taking off its skin, they saw dust (being raised far off). They said: (Akwa' and his companions) have come. So, they went away fleeing. When it was morning, the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said: Our best horseman today is AbuQatadah and our best footman today is Salamah. Then he gave me two shares of the booty - one share meant for the horseman and the other share meant for the footman - and combined both of them for me. Intending to return to Medina, he made me mount behind him on his she-camel named al-Adba'. While we were travelling, a man from the Ansar who could not be beaten in a race said: Is there anyone who could compete (with me) in a race to Medina? Is there any competitor? He continued repeating this. When I heard his talk, I said: Don't you show consideration to a dignified person and don't you have awe for a noble man? He said: No, unless he be the Messenger (peace be upon him). I said: Messenger of Allah, may my father and mother be thy ransom, let me get down so that I may beat this man (in the race). He said: If you wish, (you may). I said (to the man): I am coming to thee. I then turned my feet, sprang up and ran and gasped (for a while) when one or two elevated places were left and again followed his heel and again gasped (for a while) when one or two elevated places were left and again dashed until I joined him and gave a blow between his shoulders. I said: You have been overtaken, by God. He said: I think so. Thus, I reached Medina ahead of him.

By God, we had stayed there (in Medina) only three nights when we set out to Khaybar with the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him). (On the way) my uncle, Amir, began to recite the  following rajaz verses for the people: By God, if Thou hadst not guided us aright, We would have neither practised charity nor offered prayers. (O God!) We cannot do without Thy favours; Keep us steadfast when we encounter the enemy, And descend tranquillity upon us. The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said: Who is this? Amir said: It is Amir. He said: May thy God forgive thee! The narrator said: Whenever the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) asked forgiveness for a particular person, he was sure to embrace martyrdom. Umar bin al-Khattab who was riding on his camel called out: Prophet of Allah, I wish you had allowed us to benefit from Amir. Salamah continued: When we reached Khaybar, its king named Marhab advanced brandishing his sword and chanting: Khaybar knows that I am Marhab (who behaves like) A fully armed, and well-tried warrior, When the war comes spreading its flames. My uncle, Amir, came out to combat with him, saying: Khaybar certainly knows that I am Amir, A fully armed veteran who plunges into battles. They exchanged blows. Marhab's sword struck the shield of Amir who bent forward to attack his opponent from below, but his sword recoiled upon him and cut the main artery in his forearm which caused his death. Salamah said: I came out and heard some people among the Companions of the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him) as saying): Amir's deed has gone waste; he has killed himself. So I came to the  Holy Prophet (peace be upon him) weeping and I said: Messenger of Allah, has Amir's deed gone waste? The Messenger (peace be upon him) said: Who passed this remark? I said: Some of your Companions. He said: He who has passed that remark has told a lie, for Amir there is a double reward.  Then he sent me to Ali who had sore eyes, and said: I will give the banner to a man who loves Allah and His Messenger or whom Allah and His Messenger love. So I went to Ali, brought him beading him along as he had sore eyes, and I took him to the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him), who applied his saliva to his eyes and he got well. The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) gave him the banner (and Ali went to meet Marhab in a single combat). The latter advanced chanting: Khaybar knows certainly that I am Marhab, A fully armed and well-tried valorous warrior (hero) When war comes spreading its flames. Ali chanted in reply: I am the one whose mother named him Haydar, (And am) like a lion of the forest with a terror-striking countenance. I give my opponents the measure of sandara in exchange for sa' (i.e. return their attack with one that is much more fierce). The narrator said: Ali struck at the head of Marhab and killed him, so the victory (capture of Khaybar) was due to him.

On the Day of Uhud some of the people, being defeated, left the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him), but AbuTalhah stood before him covering him with a shield. AbuTalhah was a powerful archer who broke two or three bows that day.  When a man passed by carrying a quiver containing arrows, he would say: Spare them for AbuTalhah.  Whenever the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him) raised his head to look at the people, AbuTalhah would say: Prophet of Allah, may my father and my mother be your ransom, do not raise your head lest you be struck by an arrow shot by the enemy. My neck is before your neck.  The narrator said: I saw Aisha bint AbuBakr and Umm Sulayman. Both of them had tucked up their garments, so I could see the anklets on their feet. They were carrying water-skins on their backs and would pour water into the mouths of the people. They would then go back (to the well), fill them again and return to pour water into the mouths of the soldiers. (On this day), AbuTalhah's sword dropped down from his hands twice or thrice because of drowsiness.

It has been narrated on the authority of Yazid ibn Hurmuz that Najdah wrote to Ibn Abbas inquiring of him five things. Ibn Abbas said: If I had not the fear of committing (sin) in concealing knowledge, I should not have written to him.  Najdah wrote to him saying (after praising the Almighty and invoking blessings on the Holy Prophet): Tell me whether the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) took women to participate with him in Jihad; (if he did), whether he allotted them a regular share from the booty; whether he killed the children (of the enemy in the war); how long an orphan would be entitled to consideration as such; and for whom the Khums (fifth part of the booty) was meant.  Ibn Abbas wrote to him: You have written asking me whether the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) took women with him to participate in Jihad. He did take them to the battle and sometimes he fought alongside them. They would treat the wounded and were given a reward from the booty, but he did not assign any regular share for them.  The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) did not kill the children of the enemy, so you should not kill the children. Also you have written to me asking me when the orphanhood of an orphan comes to an end. By my life, if a young man has become bearded but is still incapable of obtaining his due from others as well as meeting his obligations towards them, (he is yet an orphan to be treated as such), but when he can look after his interests like grown-up people, he is no longer an orphan.  You have written to me, inquiring about Khums, namely, for whom it is meant. (In this connection) we (the kinsmen of the Messenger of Allah) used to say: It is for us, but those people (i.e. Banu Umayyah) have denied it to us.

It has been narrated on the authority of AbdurRahman ibn Abdu Rabb al-Ka'ba who said: I entered the mosque when Abdullah ibn Amr ibn al-'As was sitting in the shade of the Ka'bah and the people had gathered around him. I betook myself to them and sat near him.  (Now) Abdullah said: I accompanied the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) on a journey. We halted at a place. Some of us began to erect their tents, others began to compete with one another in shooting, and others began to graze their beasts, when an announcer of the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) announced that the people should gather together for prayer. So we gathered around the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him).  He said: It was the duty of every Prophet that has gone before me to guide his followers to what he knew was good for them and warn them against what he knew was bad for them. However, this Ummah of yours has its days of peace and (security) at the beginning of its career, and in the last phase of its existence it will be afflicted with trials and with things disagreeable to you.  (In this phase of the Ummah), there will be tremendous trials, one after the other, each making the previous one dwindle into insignificance. When they are afflicted with a trial, the believer will say: This is going to bring about my destruction. When (the trial) is over, they will be afflicted with another trial and the believer will say: This surely is going to be my end.  Whoever wishes to be delivered from the Fire and enter the Garden should die with faith in Allah and the Last Day and should treat the people as he wishes to be treated by them. He who swears allegiance to a Caliph should give him the pledge of his hand and the sincerity of his heart (i.e. submit to him both outwardly as well as inwardly). He should obey him to the best of his capacity. If another man comes forward (as a claimant to Caliphate), disputing his authority, they (the Muslims) should behead the latter.  The narrator says: I came close to him (Abdullah ibn Amr ibn al-'As) and said to him: Can you say on oath that you heard it from the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him)?  He pointed with his hands to his ears and his heart and said: My ears heard it and my mind retained it.  I said to him: This cousin of yours, Mu'awiyah, orders us to consume our wealth unjustly among ourselves and to kill one another, while Allah says: "O ye who believe, do not consume your wealth among yourselves unjustly, unless it be trade based on mutual agreement, and do not kill yourselves. Verily, God is Merciful to you" (iv.29).  The narrator says that (on hearing this) Abdullah ibn Amr ibn al-'As kept quiet for a while and then said: Obey him in so far as he is obedient to God; and disobey him in matters involving disobedience to God.

Anyone who stays behind looking after the family of a Mujahid and betrays his trust will be made to stand on the Day of Judgment before the Mujahid who will take away from his meritorious deeds whatever he likes.

The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) sent Busaysah as a scout to see what the caravan of AbuSufyan was doing. He came (back and met the Holy Prophet in his house) where there was nobody except myself and the Messenger of Allah. I do not remember whether he (Anas) made an exception of some wives of the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him) or not and told him the news of the caravan.  (Having heard the news), the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) came out (hurriedly), spoke to the people and said: We are in need (of men); whoever has an animal with him, ready for riding, should ride with us. People began to ask his permission to bring their riding-animals which were grazing on the hillocks near Medina.  He said: No. (I want) only those who have their riding-animals ready.  So the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) and his companions proceeded towards Badr and arrived there, forestalling the polytheists (of Mecca).  When the polytheists (also) arrived there, the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said: None of you should step forward to (do) anything unless I am ahead of him. The polytheists (now) advanced (towards us), and the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) said: Rise to enter Paradise which is equal in width to the Heavens and the Earth.  Umar ibn al-Humam al-Ansari said: Messenger of Allah, is Paradise equal in extent to the Heavens and the Earth?  He said: Yes.  Umar said: My goodness!  The Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) asked him: What prompted you to utter these words (i.e. my goodness!)? He said: Messenger of Allah, nothing but the desire that I may be among its residents. He said: You are (surely) among its residents.  He took some dates from his bag and began to eat them.  Then he said: If I were to live until I had eaten all these dates of mine, it would be a long life.  (The narrator said): He threw away all the dates he had with him.

He would say: I have missed the first battle fought by the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him), and if God now gives me an opportunity to see a battlefield with the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him), God will see what I do therein. He was afraid to say more than this (lest he be unable to keep his word with God).  He was present with the Messenger of Allah (peace be upon him) on the Day of Uhud. He met Sa'd ibn Mu'adh (who was retreating). Anas said to him: O AbuAmr, where (are you going)? Woe (to thee)! I find the smell of Paradise beside the Uhud mountain.

Two of my companions and I were so much afflicted by hunger that we had lost our sight and hearing. We presented ourselves (as guests) to the companions of the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him), but none amongst them would entertain us.  So we came to Allah's Apostle (peace be upon him), and he took us to his residence and there were three goats.  Allah's Apostle (peace be upon him) said: Milk these for us. So we milked them and each one of us drank his share and we set aside the share of Allah's Apostle (peace be upon him). (It was his habit) to come during the night and greet (the people present there) in a manner that would not wake up one who was asleep but make one who was awake hear it. He would then go to the mosque and say prayers, then go to the milk and drink it. Miqdad added: One night Satan came to me when I had taken my share, and he said: Muhammad has gone to the Ansar who will offer him hospitality and he will share what they have them, he has no need this draught (of milk).  So I took (that milk) and drank it, and when it had penetrated my stomach and I was certain that there was no way out (but to digest it), Satan aroused (my sense of) remorse and said: Woe be to thee! What have you done? You have taken the drink reserved for Muhammad! When he comes and back not find it, he will curse you. You will be ruined, and thus This world and the hereafter will be lost you. There was a sheet over me; as I pulled it my feet, my head was uncovered, and as I pulled it over my head, my feet were uncovered. I could not sleep, but my two companions had gone to sleep for they had not done what I had done. There came Allah's Apostle (peace be upon him) and he greeted us in his usual way (by saying As-salamu Alaykum). He came to the mosque and observed prayer, and then came to his drink (milk) and uncovered it but did not find anything in it. He raised his head towards the sky, and I said (to myself) that he (the Holy Prophet) was going to invoke curses upon me and I should be thus ruined.  He (the Holy Prophet) said: Allah, feed him who fed me and give drink to him who provided me with drink. I held tight the sheet upon myself (and when he had supplicated), I took hold of the knife and went to the goats (possessed by the Holy Prophet) so that I may slaughter the fattest among them for Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him). In fact all of them were milking goats. So I took hold of the vessel which belonged to the family of Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him), in which they used to milk and drink therefrom, and milked them in that until it was full of frothy milk.  I came to Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him) and he said: Have you taken your share of the milk during the night?  I said: Drink it, and he drank it. He then handed over (the vessel) to me and I said: Allah's Messenger, drink it. He drank it and handed over (the vessel) to me again. I then perceived that Allah's Apostle (peace be upon him) was satisfied and I had received his blessings.  I burst out laughing so hard that I fell upon the ground, whereupon Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him) said: Miqdad, it must be one of your mischiefs. I said: Allah's Messenger, this affair of mine is like this and this, and I have done so.  Thereupon, Allah's Apostle (peace be upon him) said: This is nothing but a mercy from Allah. Why did you not give me an opportunity to awaken our two friends and they would have received their share (of the milk)?  I said: By Him Who has sent you with Truth, I do not mind whatever you give (to them), and whatever the (other) people happen to receive, when I have received it with you from among the people.

Yazid ibn Hayyan reported: I went with Husayn ibn Sabrah and Umar ibn Muslim to Zayd ibn Arqam and, as we sat by his side, Husayn said to him: Zayd, you have been able to acquire great virtue him that you saw Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him), listened to his conversation, fought by his side in (different) battles and offered prayer behind him. Zayd, you have in fact earned a great virtue. Zayd, narrate to us what you heard from Allah`s Messenger (peace be upon him). He said: I have grown old; I have almost reached the end of my life-span and I have forgotten some of the things which I remembered in connection with Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him). So accept whatever I narrate to you, and those which I do not narrate, do not compel me to narrate them. He then said: One day Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him) stood up to deliver a sermon at a watering-place known as Khumm, situated between Mecca and Medina. He praised Allah, extolled Him, delivered the sermon, exhorted (us) and said: Now to our purpose, O people: I am a human being. Perhaps I am about to receive a messenger (the angel of death) from my Lord, and I, in response to Allah's call, (shall bid good-bye to you). But I am leaving among you two weighty things: the one being the Book of Allah in which there is right guidance and light, so hold fast to the Book of Allah and adhere to it. He exhorted (us) (to hold fast) to the Book of Allah, and then said: The second are the members of my household; I remind you (of your duties) to the members of my family. He (Husayn) said to Zayd: Who are the members of his household? Aren't his wives the members of his family? Thereupon he said: His wives are the members of his family (but here) the members of his family are those for whom acceptance of Zakat is forbidden.  And he said: Who are they? Thereupon he said: Ali and the offspring of Ali, Aqil and the offspring of Aqil, the offspring of Ja'far and the offspring of Abbas. Husayn said: These are those for whom the acceptance of Zakat is forbidden.  Zayd said: Yes.

The wives of Allah's Apostle (peace be upon him) sent Fatimah, the daughter of Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him), to Allah's Apostle (peace be upon him). She sought permission to come in as he had been lying with me in my mantle.  He gave her permission and she said: Allah's Messenger, verily your wives have sent me to you in order to ask you to observe equity in the case of the daughter of AbuQuhafah.  She (Aisha) said: I kept quiet. Thereupon Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him) said to her (Fatimah): O daughter, don't you love whom I love?  She said: Yes, (I do).  Thereupon he said: I love this one. Fatimah then stood up as she heard this from Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him) and went to the wives of Allah's Apostle (peace be upon him). She informed them of what she had said to him and what Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him) had said to her. Thereupon they said to her: We think that you have been of no avail to us. You may again go to Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him) and tell him that his wives seek equity in the case of the daughter of AbuQuhafah.  Fatimah said: By Allah, I shall never talk to him about this matter. Aisha (further) reported: The wives of Allah's Apostle (peace be upon him) then sent Zaynab bint Jahsh, the wife of Allah's Apostle (peace be upon him), and she was one who was somewhat equal in rank with me in the eyes of Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him). I have never seen a woman more advanced in religious piety than Zaynab, more God-conscious, more truthful, more alive to the ties of blood, more generous, having more sense of self-sacrifice in practical life and having a more charitable disposition and thus being closer to God, the Exalted. She, however, lost her temper very easily but was soon calm. Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him) permitted her to enter as she (Aisha) was there with Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him) in her mantle, in the same very state as when Fatimah had entered.  She said: Allah's Messenger, your wives have sent me to you, seeking equity in the case of the daughter of AbuQuhafah. She then came to me and  showed harshness to me I looked at the eyes of Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him) to see if he would permit me (to reply). Zaynab continued until I realized that Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him) would not disapprove if I retorted. Then I exchanged hot words until I made her quiet.  Thereupon Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him) smiled and said: She is the daughter of AbuBakr. This hadith has been narrated on the authority of Zuhri with the same chain of transmitters, but with a slight variation of wording.

Abdullah ibn as-Samit reported that AbuDharr said: We set out from our tribe Ghifar who look upon the prohibited months as permissible months. My brother Unays, our mother and I stayed with our maternal uncle who treated us well.  The men of his tribe felt jealous and they said: When you are away from your house, Unays commits adultery with your wife. Our maternal uncle came and he accused us of the sin about which he had been informed.  I said: You have undone the good you did to us. We cannot stay with you after this. We came to our camels and loaded (our) luggage. Our maternal uncle began to weep, covering himself with (a piece of) cloth. We proceeded until we encamped by the side of Mecca. Unays cast lot on the camels (we had) and an equal number (above that). They both went to a Kahin and he made Unays win and Unays came with our camels and an equal number along with them. He (AbuDharr) said: My nephew, I used to observe prayer three years before my meeting with Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him).  I said: To whom did you say your prayer?  He said: To Allah.  I said: In which direction did you turn your face (for observing prayer)?  He said: I used to turn my face as Allah has directed me to turn my face. I used to observe the night prayer towards the end of night and I fell down in prostration like a mantle until the sun rose over me. Unays said: I have work in Mecca, so you had better stay here. Unays continued until he came to Mecca and he came back to me late.  I said: What did you do?  He said: I met a person in Mecca who is of your religion and he claims that verily it is Allah Who has sent him.  I said: What do the people say about him? He said: They say that he is a poet or a Kahin or magician. Unays who was himself one of the poets said: I have heard the words of a Kahin but his words in no way resemble his (words). I also compared his words with the verses of poets but such words cannot be uttered by any poet. By Allah, he is truthful and they are liars.  Then I said: You stay here while I go to see him. He said: I came to Mecca and I selected an insignificant person from amongst them and said to him: Where is he whom you call a Sabi?  He pointed towards me, saying: He is Sabi. Thereupon the people of the valley attacked me with sods and bows until I fell down unconscious. I stood up after regaining consciousness and I found that I resembled a red idol. I came to Zamzam, washed blood from myself and drank water from it. Listen, O son of my brother, I stayed there for thirty nights or days and there was no food for me but the water of Zamzam. And I became so emaciated that there appeared wrinkles upon my stomach, yet I did not feel any hunger in my stomach. It was during this time that the people of Mecca slept during the moonlit night and there was none to circumambulate the House except two women who had been invoking the name of Isafa and Na'ilah (the two idols). They came to me while on their circuit and I said: Marry one to the other, but they did not dissuade from their invocation. They came to me and I said to them: Insert wood (in the idols' private parts). (I said this to them in such plain words) as I could not express it in metaphorical terms. These women went away crying and saying: Had there been one amongst our people (he would have taught a lesson to you for the obscene words used for our idols before us). These women met Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him) and AbuBakr who had also been coming down the hill.  He asked them: What has happened to you?  They said: It is Sabi, who has hidden himself between the Ka'bah and its curtain.  He said: What did he say to you?  They said: He uttered such words before us as we cannot express. Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him) came and he kissed the Black Stone, circumambulated the House along with his companion and then observed prayer. AbuDharr said: When he had finished his prayer, I was the first to greet him with the salutation of peace and uttered (the words) in this way Allah's Messenger, may there be peace upon you. Thereupon he said: May it be upon you too, and the mercy of Allah. He then said: Who are you?  I said: From the tribe of Ghifar.  He praised his hand and placed his finger on his forehead and I said to myself: Perhaps he does not like my belonging to the tribe of Ghifar. I attempted to catch hold of his hand but his friend, who knew about him more than I, dissuaded me from doing so. He then lifted his head and said: For how long have you been here?  I said: I have been here for the last thirty nights or days.  He said: Who has been feeding you?  I said: There has been no food for me but the water of Zamzam. I have grown so emaciated that there are wrinkles upon my stomach and I do not feel any hunger. He said: It is blessed (water) and it also serves as food. Thereupon AbuBakr said: Allah's Messenger, let me serve as a host to him for tonight. Then Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him) proceeded forth, so did AbuBakr, and I went with them. AbuBakr opened the door and then he brought for us the raisins of Ta'if and that was the first food which I ate there. Then I stayed as long as I had to stay. I then came to Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him) and he said: I have been shown the land abounding in trees and I think it must be that of Yathrib (that is the old name of Medina). You are a preacher to your people on my behalf. I hope Allah will benefit them through you and He will reward you.  I came to Unays and he said: What have you done?  I said: What I have done is to embrace Islam and testify (to the prophethood of Allah's Messenger). He said: I have no aversion for your religion and I also embrace Islam and testify (to the prophethood of Muhammad). Then both of us came to our mother and she said: I have no aversion for your religion and I also embrace Islam and testify to the prophethood of Muhammad. We then loaded our camels and came to our tribe Ghifar and half of the tribe embraced Islam and their chief was Ayma' ibn Rahadah Ghifari and he was their leader and half of the tribe said: We will embrace Islam when Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him) would come to Medina, and when Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him) came to Medina the remaining half also embraced Islam. Then the tribe Aslam came to the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him) and said: Allah's Messenger, we also embrace Islam like our brothers who have embraced Islam. And they also embraced Islam. Thereupon Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him) said: Allah granted pardon to the tribe of Ghifar and Allah saved (from destruction) the tribe of Aslam.

Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him) said: Satirize the (non-believing amongst the) Quraysh, for (satire) is more grievous to them than the hurt of an arrow. So he (the Holy Prophet) sent (someone) to Ibn Rawahah and asked him to satirise them. He composed a satire, but it did not appeal to him (to the Holy Prophet). He then sent (someone) to Ka'b ibn Malik (to do the same, but what he composed did not appeal to the Holy Prophet). He then sent one to Hassan ibn Thabit. As he entered his presence, Hassan said: Now you have called for this lion who strikes (the enemies) with his tail. He then brought out his tongue and began to move it and said: By Him Who has sent you with Truth, I shall tear them with my tongue as the leather is torn. Thereupon Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him) said: Don't be hasty; (let) AbuBakr who has the best knowledge of the lineage of the Quraysh draw a distinction for you in regard to my lineage, as my lineage is the same as theirs. Hassan then came to him (AbuBakr) and after making inquiries (in regard to the lineage of the Holy Prophet) came back to him (the Holy Prophet) and said: Allah's Messenger, he (AbuBakr) has drawn a distinction your lineage (and that of the Quraysh). By Him Who has sent you with Truth, I shall draw out from them (your name) as hair is drawn out from the flour. Aisha said: I heard Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him) saying to Hassan: Verily Ruh al-Qudus will continue to help you so long as you put up a defence on behalf of Allah and his Messenger. And she said: I heard Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him) saying: Hassan satirized them and gave satisfaction to the (Muslims) and disquieted (the non-Muslims). You satirized Muhammad, but I replied on his behalf, and there is a reward from Allah for this. You satirized Muhammad, the virtuous, the righteous, the Apostle of Allah, whose nature is truthfulness. So verily my father, his father and my honour are a protection to the honour of Muhammad. May I lose my dear daughter if you don't see her wiping away the dust from both sides of Kada. They pull at the reins, going upward. On their shoulders are spears thirsting (for the blood of the enemy). Our steeds are sweating--our women wipe them with their mantles. If you had not interfered with us, we should have performed the Umrah. And (then) there was the Victory, and the darkness cleared away. Otherwise wait for the fighting on the day on which Allah will honour whom He pleases.  Allah said: I have sent a servant who says the Truth in which there is no ambiguity. Allah said: I have prepared an army--they are the Ansar whose object is fighting (the enemy). There arrives every day from Ma'add abuse, fighting or satire. Whoever among you satirizes the Apostle, or praises him and helps him it is all the same; and Gabriel, the Apostle of Allah is among us, and the Holy Spirit who has no match.

Umar said: Where do you intend to go?  He said: To Kufah.  He (Umar) said: Let me write a letter for you to its governor. Thereupon he (Uways) said: I love to live amongst the poor people. The following year, a man from the elite (of Kufah) performed Hajj and he met Umar. He asked him about Uways.  He said: I left him in a state of meagre means of sustenance.

He has been suffered from leprosy, which has been cured except for a patch the size of a dirham. His treatment of his mother has been very kind.

AbuNawfal reported: I saw (the dead body of) Abdullah ibn Zubayr hanging on the road of Medina (leading to Mecca). The Quraysh passed by it and other people too.  Then Abdullah ibn Umar happened to pass by it.  He stood there and said: May there be peace upon you, AbuKhubayb (the Kunya of Abdullah ibn Zubayr); may there be peace upon you, AbuKhubayb; may there be peace upon you, AbuKhubayb! By Allah, I used to forbid you to do this; by Allah, I used to forbid you to do this; by Allah, I used to forbid you to do this. By Allah, so far as I know, you had been very much devoted to fasting and prayer and you had been taking great care to cement blood-ties. By Allah, the group to which you, as a wicked person belong, is indeed a fine group. Then Abdullah ibn Umar went away.  The stand Abdullah (bin Umar) took in regard to the inhuman treatment (meted out to Abdullah ibn Zubayr) and his words (in that connection) were conveyed to Hajjaj (ibn Yusuf) and (as a consequence of that) he (the body of Abdullah ibn Zubayr) was brought down from the stump (the scaffold) from which it was hanging and thrown into the graves of the Jews. He (Hajjaj) sent (his messenger) to Asma' (bint AbuBakr), Abdullah's mother. But she refused to come. He again sent the messenger to her with the message that she must come, otherwise he would bring her forcibly by the hair.  But she again refused and said: By Allah, I shall not come to you until you send to me one who will drag me by the hair.  Thereupon he said: Bring me my shoes. He put on his shoes and walked quickly, swollen with vanity and pride until he came to her and said: How do you find what I have done with the enemy of Allah?  She said: I find that you wronged him in this world; whereas he has spoiled your next life. It has been conveyed to me that you used to call him (Abdullah ibn Zubayr) the son of one having two belts. By Allah, I am indeed (a woman) of two belts. With the help of one of them I used to suspend high the food of Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him) and that of AbuBakr (keeping it out of the reach) of animals and, so far as the second belt is concerned, that is the belt which no woman can dispense with.  Verily Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him) told us that in Thaqif there would be born a great liar and great murderer. The liar we have seen, and as far as the murderer is concerned, I do not find anyone else besides you. Thereupon he (Hajjaj) stood up and did not give any reply to her.

There was an orphan girl living with Umm Sulaym (who was the mother of Anas).  Allah's Apostle (peace be upon him) saw that orphan girl and said: O, it is you; you have grown young. May you not advance in years! The slave-girl returned to Umm Sulaym, weeping.  Umm Sulaym said: O daughter, what is the matter with you?  She said: Allah's Apostle (peace be upon him) has invoked a curse upon me that I should not grow in age and thus I shall never grow in age, or she said, in my (length) of life.  Umm Sulaym went out, having hurriedly wrapped her head in a shawl, to meet Allah's Apostle (peace be upon him).  He said to her: Umm Sulaym, what is the matter with you? She said: Allah's Apostle (peace be upon him) , you invoked a curse upon my orphan girl.  He said: Umm Sulaym, what is that? She said: She (the orphan girl) states you have cursed her, saying that she might not grow in age or grow in (length of) life.  Allah's Apostle (peace be upon him) smiled and then said: Umm Sulaym, don't you know that I have made this stipulation with my Lord. And the stipulation with my Lord is that I said to Him: I am a human being and I am pleased just as a human being is pleased and I lose temper just as a human being loses my temper. So for any person from amongst my Ummah, whom I curse and he in no way deserves it, let that, O Lord, be made a source of purification, purity and nearness to (Allah) on the Day of Resurrection.

He who treads the path in search of knowledge, Allah will make that path easy, leading to Paradise for him and those persons who assemble in one of the houses of Allah (mosques), recite the Book of Allah and learn and teach the Qur'an (among themselves). There will descend upon them tranquillity, mercy will cover them, the angels will surround them and Allah will mention them in the presence of those near Him. He who is slow-paced in doing good deeds, his (long) descent does not make him go ahead.

Mu'awiyah went to a circle in the mosque and said: What makes you sit here?  They said: We are sitting here in order to remember Allah.  He said: I adjure you by Allah (to tell me whether you are sitting here for this very purpose)?  They said: By Allah, we are sitting here for this very purpose. Thereupon, he said: I have not ordered you to take an oath, because of any allegation against you and none of my rank in the eye of Allah's Apostle (peace be upon him) is the narrator of so few hadiths as I am.  The fact is that Allah's Apostle (peace be upon him) went out to the circle of his companions and said: What makes you sit there?  They said: We are sitting here in order to remember Allah and to praise Him because He guided us to the path of Islam and He conferred favours upon us. Thereupon he adjured by Allah and asked if that were the only purpose of their sitting there.  They said: By Allah, we are not sitting out here for this very purpose. Thereupon he (the Apostle (peace be upon him) said: I am not asking you to take an oath because of any allegation against you but for the fact that Gabriel came to me and he informed me that Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, was talking to the angels about your magnificence.

He said: By Lat and Uzza, if I were to see him do that, I should trample his neck, or I should besmear his face with dust.  He came to Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him) as he was engaged in prayer and thought of trampling his neck. (The people say) that he came near him but turned upon his heels and tried to repulse something with his hands.  It was said to him: What is the matter with you?  He said: There is between me and him a ditch of fire and terror and wings. Thereupon Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him) said: If he had come near me the angels would have torn him to pieces.  Then Allah, the Exalted and glorious, revealed this verse--(the narrator) said: We do not know whether it is the hadith transmitted to AbuHurayrah or something conveyed to him from another source: "Nay, man is surely inordinate, because he looks upon himself as self-sufficient. Surely to thy Lord is the return. Hast thou seen him who forbids a servant when he prays? Seest thou if he is on the right way, or enjoins observance of piety? Seest thou if he (AbuJahl) denies and turns away? Knowest he not that Allah sees? Nay, if he desists not, We shall seize him by the forelock--a lying, sinful forelock. Then let him summon his council. We shall summon the guards of the Hell. Nay! Obey not thou him" (lcvi.6-19). (Rather prostrate thyself.)

Verily, Allah looked towards the people of the world and He showed hatred for the Arabs and the non-Arabs, with the exception of some remnants from the People of the Book.  He (further) said: I have sent thee (the Holy Prophet) in order to put you to the test and put (those to the test) through you. I sent the Book to you, which cannot be washed away by water, so that you may recite it while in the state of wakefulness or sleep."  Verily, Allah commanded me to burn (kill) the Quraysh.  I said: My Lord, they would break my head (like the tearing) of bread.  Allah said: You turn them out as they turned you out, you fight against them and We shall help you in this, you spend and you will be given more. You send an army and I shall send an army five times greater than that. Fight with those who obey you against those who disobey you.  The inmates of Paradise are of three types: one who wields authority and is just and fair; one who is truthful and has been endowed with power to do good deeds; and the person who is merciful and kind-hearted towards his relatives and to every pious Muslim, and who does not stretch out his hand in spite of having a large family to support.  He continued: The inmates of Hell are of five types: the weak who lack power to (avoid evil), the (carefree) who pursue (everything irrespective of the fact that it is good or evil) and who do not have any care for their family or for their wealth those dishonest people whose greed cannot be concealed even in the case of minor things; and the third type, who betrays you morning and evening, in regard to your family and your property.

I came on the day of Jara'ah when someone was sitting there.  I said: They will shed their blood today.  The other person said: By Allah, not at all.  I said: By Allah, of course, they will do it.  He said: By Allah, they will not do it.  I said: By Allah, of course, they will do it.  He said: By Allah, they will not do it, and I have a hadith of Allah's Apostle (peace be upon him), which I shall narrate to you in this connection.  I said: You are a bad  fellow to sit with. I have been opposing you since morning and you listen to me in spite of the fact that you have heard a hadith from Allah's Apostle (peace be upon him) (contrary to my statement).  I myself felt that there was no need for this annoyance. (He could have told me earlier that it was a hadith of the Holy Prophet (peace be upon him), and I should not have opposed him at all.) I turned my face toward him his name asked him and he was Hudhayfah.

So they would fight and ninety-nine out of one hundred would be killed. AbuKamil in his narration said: I and AbuKa'b stood under the shade of the battlement of Hassan.

Allah's Apostle (peace be upon him) said: The Last Hour will not come until the Romans land at al-A'maq or in Dabiq. An army consisting of the best (soldiers) of the people on Earth at that time will come from Medina (to oppose them).  When they arrange themselves in ranks, the Romans will say: Do not stand between us and those (Muslims) who took prisoners from among us. Let us fight them. The Muslims will say: Nay, by Allah, we shall never turn aside from you and from our brethren so that you may fight them.  They will then fight and a third (part) of the army, whom Allah will never forgive, will run away. A third (part of the army), which will be constituted of excellent martyrs in Allah's eyes, would be killed. The third who will never be put on trial will win and they will be the conquerors of Constantinople.  As they are busy in distributing the spoils of war (amongst themselves) after hanging their swords by the olive trees, Satan will cry: The Dajjal has taken your place among your families. They will then come out, but it will be of no avail. When they reach Syria, he will come out while they are still preparing themselves for battle, drawing up the ranks.  Certainly, the time of prayer will come and then Jesus (peace be upon him), son of Mary, descend and will lead them in prayer. When the enemy of Allah see him, it will (disappear) just as salt dissolves in water and if he (Jesus) were not to confront them at all, even then it would dissolve completely. Allah would kill them by his hand and he would show them their blood on his lance (the lance of Jesus Christ).

Once there blew a red storm in Kufah and there came a person who had nothing to say but (these words): Abdullah ibn Mas'ud, the Last Hour has come. He (Abdullah ibn Mas'ud) was sitting reclining against something, and he said: The Last Hour will not come until the people divide inheritance and rejoice over booty. Then He said pointing towards Syria, with a gesture of his hand like this: The enemy will muster strength against the Muslims and the Muslims will muster strength against them (Syrians).  I said: You mean Rome?  He said: Yes, and there will be a terrible fight. The Muslims will prepare a detachment (for fighting unto death) which will not return unless victorious. They will fight until darkness intervenes. Both sides will return without being victorious and both will be wiped out. The Muslims will again prepare a detachment for fighting unto death so that they may not return unless victorious.  When it is the fourth day, a new detachment from the remnant of the Muslims will be prepared and Allah will decree that the enemy will be routed.  They would fight such a fight the like of which has not been seen, so fierce that even if a bird were to pass their flanks, it would fall down dead before reaching the other end. (There will be such a large scale massacre) that when counting will be done, (only) one out of a hundred men related to one another would be found alive. So what can be the joy at the spoils of such war and what inheritance can be divided?  They will be in this very state when they will hear of a calamity more horrible than this.  A cry will reach them: The Dajjal has taken your place among your offspring. They will therefore throw away what is in their hands and go forward, sending ten horsemen as a scouting party.  Allah's Apostle (peace be upon him) said: I know their names, the names of their forefathers and the colour of their horses. They will be the best horsemen on the surface of the Earth on that day or among the best horsemen on the surface of the Earth on that day.

Dressed in woollen clothes, they stood near a hillock and met Allah's Apostle (peace be upon him) as was sitting.  I said to myself: I had better go to them and stand between him and them so that they may not attack him. Then I thought that perhaps there were secret negotiations going on between them. However, I went to them and stood between them and him and remember four of the words (on that occasion), which I repeat (on the fingers of my hand), that he (Allah's Apostle p.) said: You will attack Arabia and Allah will enable you to conquer it, then you will attack Persia and He will cause you to conquer it. Then you will attack Rome and Allah will enable you to conquer it, then you will attack the Dajjal and Allah will enable you to conquer him.

Allah's Apostle (peace be upon him) mentioned of the Dajjal one day in the morning. He sometimes described him as insignificant and sometimes described (his turmoil) as very significant (and we felt) as if he were in the cluster of the date-palm trees.  When we went to him (to the Holy Prophet) in the evening and he read (the signs of fear) on our faces, he said: What is the matter with you?  We said: Allah's Apostle (peace be upon him) you mentioned the Dajjal this morning (sometimes describing him) as insignificant and sometimes very important, until we began to think he was present in some (nearly) part of the cluster of the date-palm trees. So he said: I harbour fear in regard to you in so many other things besides the Dajjal. If he comes forth while I am among you, I shall contend with him on your behalf, but if he comes forth while I am not among you, a man must contend on his own behalf and Allah will take care of every Muslim on my behalf (and safeguard him against his evil). He (the Dajjal) will be a young man with twisted, cropped hair, and a blind eye. I compare him with AbdulUzza ibn Qatan. He who among you will survive to see him should recite over him the opening verses of Surah al-Kahf (xviii). He will appear on the way between Syria and Iraq and will spread mischief right and left. O servant of Allah! Adhere (to the path of Truth). We said: Allah's Apostle (peace be upon him), how long will he stay on Earth?  He said: For forty days, one day like a year, one day like a month, one day like a week, and the rest of the days will be like your days.  We said: Allah's Apostle (peace be upon him) will one day's prayer suffice for the prayers of the day equal to one year? Thereupon he said: No, but you must make an estimate of the time (and then observe prayer). We said: Allah's apostle (peace be upon him) how quickly will he walk upon the earth?  Thereupon he said: Like cloud driven by the wind. He will come to the people and invite them (to a wrong religion); they will affirm their faith in him and respond to him. He will then give a command to the sky: there will be rainfall upon the Earth and it will grow crops. Then in the evening, their pasturing animals will come to them with their humps very high, their udders full of milk and their flanks distended. He will then come to another people and invite them. But they will reject him so he will go away from them; they will have a drought and nothing will be left with them in the form of wealth. He will then walk through the desert and say to it: Bring forth your treasures. The treasures will come out and gather before him like a swarm of bees. He will then call someone in the flush of youth, strike him with the sword, cut him into two pieces and (make these pieces lie at the distance which is generally between the archer and his target. He will then call (that young man) and he will come forward laughing with his face gleaming (with happiness). It will at this very time that Allah will send Christ, son of Mary. He will descend at the white minaret on the eastern side of Damascus, wearing two garments lightly dyed with saffron and placing his hands on the wings of two Angels. When he lowers his head, there will fall beads of perspiration from his head, and when he raises it up, beads like pearls will scatter from it. Every non-believer who smells the odour of his body will die and his breath will reach as far as he is able to see. He will then search for him (Dajjal) until he catches hold of him at the gate of Ludd and kills him. Then a people whom Allah had protected will come to Jesus, son of Mary, and he will wipe their faces and inform them of their ranks in Paradise.  It will be under such conditions that Allah will reveal to Jesus these words: I have brought forth from among My servants such people against whom none will be able to fight; you take these people safely to Tur, and then Allah will send Gog and Magog and they will swarm down from every slope. The first of them will pass the lake of Tiberias and drink out of it.  And when the last of them passes, he will say: There was once water there. Jesus and his companions will then be besieged here (at Tur, and they will be so hard pressed) that the head of the ox will be dearer to them than one hundred dinars. Allah's Apostle (peace be upon him), Jesus, and his companions will supplicate Allah, Who will send to them insects (which will attack their necks) and in the morning they would perish as one single person. Allah's Apostle (peace be upon him), Jesus, and his companions, then come down to Earth and they will not find on Earth as much space as a single span that is not filled with putrefaction and stench. Allah's Apostle (peace be upon him), Jesus, and his companions will then beseech Allah who will send birds whose necks would be like those of Bactrian camels and they will carry them away and throw them where Allah wills. Then Allah will send rain which no house of mud-bricks or (tent of) camel-hair will keep out and it will wash the Earth until it resembles a mirror. Then the Earth will be told to bring forth its fruit and restore its blessing and, as a result thereof, there will grow (such a big) pomegranate that a group of people will be able to eat it and seek shelter under its skin, a dairy cow will give so much milk that a whole party will be able to drink it. The milking camel will give such (a large quantity of) milk that the whole tribe will be able to drink from it, and the milking-sheep will give so much milk that the whole family will be able to drink from it. At that time Allah will send a pleasant wind which will soothe (people) even under their armpits. He will take the life of every Muslim and only the wicked will survive who will commit adultery like asses and the Last Hour would come to them.

Thereupon he said: Hallowed be Allah, there is no god but Allah (or words to the same effect). I have decided that I shall not narrate anything to anyone now. I have only said that you will see after some time an important event: that the (sacred) House (Ka'bah) will be burnt and it definitely happen.  He then reported that Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him) said: The Dajjal will appear in my Ummah and he will stay (in the world) for forty--I cannot say whether he meant forty days, forty months or forty years. Allah will then send Jesus, son of Mary, who will resemble Urwah ibn Mas'ud. He (Jesus Christ) will chase him and kill him. Then people will live for seven years, during which time there will be no rancour between any two persons. After that Allah will send a cold wind from the direction of Syria. None will survive on Earth, having a speck of good in him or faith in him: he will die. Even if some among you were to enter the innermost part of the mountain, this wind would reach that place also and cause your death.  I heard Allah's Apostle (peace be upon him) as saying: Only the wicked people will survive and they will be as careless as birds with the characteristics of beasts. They will never appreciate good nor condemn evil.  Then Satan will come to them, in human form, and would say: Don't you respond?  They will say: What do you order us to do? He will command them to worship the idols but, in spite of this, they will have an abundance of sustenance and lead comfortable lives. Then the trumpet will be blown and he who hears it will bend his neck to one side and raise it from the other side. The first one to hear that trumpet will be the person who is busy in setting right the cistern meant for supplying water to the camels. He will faint and the other people will also faint. Then Allah will send or He will cause to be sent rain which will be like dew and there will grow out of it the bodies of people.  Then the second trumpet will be blown and they will stand up and begin to look (around).  Then it will be said: O people, go to your Lord. They will be made to stand there and they will be questioned.  Then it will be said: Bring out a group (of them) for the Hell-Fire. It will be asked: How much?

.hadithNarrator Fatimah, daughter of Qays and sister of ad-Dahhak ibn Qays
Amir ibn Sharahil ash-Sha'bi said: Fatimah bint Qays was among the first emigrant women. I asked her to narrate to me a hadith which she had heard directly from Allah's Apostle (peace be upon him) and there was no extra link between them.  She said: Very well, if you like, I am prepared to do that. He said to her: Well, do so and narrate it to me. She said: I married the son of Mughirah and he was a chosen young man of Quraysh at that time, but he fell as a martyr in the first Jihad (fighting on the side of Allah's Apostle (peace be upon him)). When I became a widow, AbdurRahman ibn Awf, one of the group of the companions of Allah's Apostle. sent me a proposal of marriage. Allah's Apostle (peace be upon him) also sent me such a message for his freed slave, Usamah ibn Zayd. It had been conveyed to me that Allah's Apostle (peace be upon him) had said (about Usamah): He who loves me should also love Usamah.  When Allah's Apostle (peace be upon him) talked to me (about this matter), I said: My affairs are in your hands. You may marry me to anyone you wish. He said: You had better move now to the house of Umm Sharik. Umm Sharik was a rich lady from among the Ansar. She spent generously for the cause of Allah and entertained guests very hospitably.  I said: Well, I shall do as you wish. He said: Do not do that because Umm Sharik is a woman who is very frequently visited by guests and I do not like your head to be uncovered or removed from your shank and the strangers may catch sight of that which you abhor. You had better move to the house of your cousin, Abdullah ibn Amr ibn Umm Maktum. He was one of the Banu Fihr branch of the Quraysh, and he belonged to that tribe (to which Fatimah) belonged. So I moved to that house, and when my period of waiting was over, I heard the voice of an announcer making an announcement that the prayer would be observed in the mosque (where) congregational prayer (is observed). So I set out towards the mosque and observed prayer with the Allah's Apostle (peace be upon him) and I was in the row of the women which was near the row of men.  When Allah's Apostle (peace be upon him) had finished his prayer, he sat on the pulpit, smiling, and said: Every worshipper should remain sitting in his place. He then said: Do you know why I have asked you to assemble?  They said: Allah and His apostle know best. He said: By Allah, I have not made you assemble for exhortation or for a warning. I have detained you here because Tamim Dari, a Christian who came and accepted Islam, told me something which agrees with what I was telling you about the Dajjal. He narrated to me that he had sailed in a ship with thirty men of Banu Lakhm and Banu Judham and had been tossed by waves in the ocean for a month. Then these (waves) took them (near) the land within the ocean (island) at the time of sunset. They sat in a small rowing-boat and landed on that island. There was a beast with long thick hair (and because of this) they could not distinguish his face from his back.  They said: Woe to you, who can you be? Thereupon it said: I am al-Jassasah.  They said: What is al-Jassasah? It said: O people, go to this person in the monastery as he is very much eager to know about you.  He (the narrator) said: When it named a person for us we were afraid of it lest it should be a Devil. Then we hurried on till we came to that monastery and found a well-built person there with his hands tied to his neck and iron shackles gripping his legs by the ankles.  We said: Woe to you, who are you? He said: You soon come to know about me, but tell me who you are.  We said: We are people from Arabia and we embarked upon a boat but the waves had been driving us for one month and they brought us near this island. We took to the rowing-boats and landed on this island. Here a beast with profusely thick hair met us and because of the thickness of his hair his face could not be distinguished from his back. We said: Woe be to thee, who are you?  It said: I am al- Jassasah.  We said: What is al-Jassasah?  It said: You go to this very person in the monastery for he is eagerly waiting for you to know about you. So we came to you in hot haste fearing that that might be the Devil.  He (that chained person) said: Tell me about the date-palm trees of Baysan.  We said: In which respect do you seek information about it?  He said: I ask you whether these trees bear fruit or not.  We said: Yes.  Thereupon he said: I think these will not bear fruit. He said: Inform me about the lake of Tabariyyah?  We said: What do you want to know about it?  He said: Is there water in it?  They said: There is an abundance of water in it. Thereupon he said: I think it will soon dry up. He again said: Inform me about the spring of Zughar.  They said: What do you want to know about it?  He (the chained person) said: Is there water in it and does it irrigate (the land)?  We said to him: Yes, there is an abundance of water in it and the inhabitants (of Medina) irrigate (land) with its help.  He said: Inform me about the unlettered Prophet; what has he done?  We said: He has left Mecca and has settled in Yathrib (Medina).  He said: Do the Arabs fight against him?  We said: Yes.  He said: How does he deal with him?  We informed him that he had overcome those in his neighbourhood and they had submitted themselves before him. Thereupon he said to us: Had it actually happened?  We said: Yes. Thereupon he said: If it is so that is better for them that they show obedience to him. I am going to tell you about myself. I am the Dajjal and will be soon permitted to leave. So I shall leave and travel in the land, and shall not spare any town where I shall not stay for forty nights except Mecca and Medina: these two (places) are prohibited (areas) for me and I shall not attempt to enter either of them. An angel with a sword in his hand will confront me and bar my way and there will be angels to guard every road leading to it. Then Allah's apostle (peace be upon him) striking the pulpit with the help of the end of his staff said: This implies Tayba meaning Medina. Have I not told you an account (of the Dajjal) like this? The people said: Yes, and this account narrated by Tamim Dari was liked by me for it corroborates the account which I gave to you in regard to him (Dajjal) at Medina and Mecca. Behold he (Dajjal) is in the Syrian sea (Mediterranean) or the Yemen sea (Arabian sea). Nay, on the contrary, he is in the east, he is in the east, he is in the east, and he pointed with his hand towards the east. I (Fatimah bint Qays) said: I preserved it in my mind (this narration from Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him).

By Allah, it will be fully packed. Do you find it somewhat strange? It has been mentioned that there stretch a distance, which one can cover in forty years, from one end of Paradise to the other, and a day will come when it is fully packed. You must know that I was the seventh of seven who had been with Allah's Apostle (peace be upon him) and we had nothing to eat but the leaves of the tree until the corners of our mouths were cracked.

Allah's Apostle (peace be upon him) said: There lived a king before you and he had a (court) magician.  As he (the magician) grew old, he said to the king: I have grown old, send some young boy to me so that I may teach him magic. He (the king) sent to him a young man so that he might train him (in magic). On his way (to the magician) he (the young man) found a monk sitting there. He (the young man) listened to his (the monk's) talk and was impressed by it. It became his habit that on his way to the magician he met the monk set there so he was late in coming to the magician. He (the magician) beat him because of the delay. He made a complaint about it to the monk and he said to him: When you feel afraid of the magician, say: Members of my family detained me. And when you feel afraid of your family you should say: The magician detained me. It so happened that there came a huge beast (of prey) and it blocked the way of the people. He (the young boy) said: I shall find out today whether the magician or the monk is superior. He picked up a stone and said: O Allah, if the affairs of the monk are dearer to Thee than the affairs of the magician, bring death to this animal so that the people will be able to move about freely. He threw that stone towards it and killed it and the people began to move about (on the path freely). He (the young man) then came to that monk and informed him. The monk said: My son, today you are superior to me. Your affairs have reached a stage where I find that you will be soon put to the test, and in case you are put to don't reveal my identity. That young man began to treat the blind and those suffering from leprosy and he in fact began to cure people of (all kinds) of illness. When a companion of the king, who had become blind heard, about him, he came to him with numerous gifts and said: If you cure me, all these things collected together here will be yours. He said: I myself do not cure anyone; it is Allah Who cures. If you affirm faith in Allah, I shall also supplicate Allah to cure you. He affirmed his faith in Allah and Allah cured him. He came to the king and sat by his side as he used to sit before.  The king said to him: Who restored your eyesight?  He said: My Lord.  Thereupon he said: It means that your Lord is One besides me.  He said: My Lord and your Lord is Allah; so he (the king) took hold of him and tormented him until he revealed the identity of boy. The young man was thus summoned and the king said to him: O boy, it has been conveyed to me that you have become so proficient in your magic that you cure the blind and those suffering from leprosy and you do such and such things. Thereupon he said: I do not cure anyone; it is Allah Who cures. He (the king) took hold of him and began to torment him. So he revealed the identity of the monk.  The monk was thus summoned and it was said to him: You should turn back from your religion. He, however, refused to do so. He (ordered) a saw to be brought (and when it was done) he (the king) placed it in the middle of his head and backed it until it fell apart. Then the courtier of the king was brought and it was said to him: Turn back from your religion but he refused to do so. Therefore the saw was placed in the middle of his head which was backed until it fell apart.  Then young boy was brought and it was said to him: Turn back from your religion. He refused to do so and he was handed over to a group of his courtier. He said to them: Take him to such and such mountain; make him climb that mountain and when you reach its top (ask him to renounce his faith) but if he refuses to do so, then throw him (down the mountain). So they took him and made him climb the mountain and he said: O Allah, save me from them (in any way) Thou likest. The mountain began to quake and they all fell down young man came walking back to the king.  The king said to him: What has happened to your companions?  He said: Allah has saved me from them.  He again handed him to some of his courtiers and said: Take him and carry him away in a small boat and when you reach the middle of the ocean (ask him to renounce) his religion, but if he does not renounce his religion throw him (into the water). So they took him and he said: O Allah, save me from them and what they want to do. It was not long before the boat overturned and they were drowned but he came walking back to the king. The king said to him: What has happened to your companions? He said: Allah has saved me from them. He also said to the king: You cannot kill me until you do what I ask you to do. And he said: What is that? He said: You should gather people on a plain and hang me by the trunk (of a tree). Then take an arrow from the quiver and say: In the name of Allah, the Lord of the world; then shoot an arrow and if you do that then you would be able to kill me. So he (the king) called the people to an open plain and tied him (the boy) to the trunk of a tree. Then he took an arrow from his quiver placed the arrow in the bow and then said: In the name of Allah, the Lord of the young boy; he then shot an arrow and it hit his temple. He (the boy) placed his hands upon the temple where the arrow had hit him and he. The people said: We affirm our faith in the Lord of this young man, we affirm our faith in the Lord of this young man, we affirm our faith in the Lord of this young man.  The courtiers came to the king and it was said to him: Do you see that their faith is in the Lord?  He (the king) commanded ditches to be dug at important points in the path. When these ditches were dug, and the fire was lit in them it was said (to the people): He who not turn back from his (boy's) religion will be thrown in the fire or they will be told to jump in it. (The people courted death but did not renounce religion) till a woman came with her child and she felt hesitant about jumping into the fire the child said to her: O mother, endure (this ordeal) for it is the Truth.

There was a young man with him, who carried the record of letter with him, and he wore a mantle prepared by the tribe of Ma'afiri. His servant too were a Ma'afiri mantle. My father said to him: My uncle, I see the signs of anger or agony on your face.  He said: Yes, a certain person, the son of so and so, of the tribe of Harami was in debt to me, I went to his family, greeted them and said: Where is he?  They said: He is not here. Then there came out to me his son who was on the threshold of youth.  I said to him: Where is your father?  He said: No sooner did he hear your arrival than he hid himself behind my mother's bed.  I said to him: come out to me, for I know where you are. He came out.  I said to him: What prompted you to hide yourself from me? He said: By Allah, whatever I say to you will not be a lie. By Allah, I fear lest I should tell a lie to you and in the case of making promise you I should break it, as you are the companion of Allah's Apostle (peace be upon him). The fact is that I was hard up in regard to money.  I said: Do you adjure by Allah?  He said: I adjure by Allah.  I said: Do you adjure by Allah?  He said: I adjure by Allah.  I said: Do you adjure by Allah?  He said: I adjure by Allah. Then he brought his promissory note and he wrote off (the debt) with his hand and said: Make payment when you find yourself solvent enough to pay me back; if you are not, then there is no liability upon you. Saw with my own eyes he (AbulYasar) placed his fingers upon his eyes, I heard with my own ears and it was lodged in my heart, he pointed towards his heart, that Allah's Apostle (peace be upon him) said: He who gives time to one who is financially hard up (in the payment of debt) or writes off his debt, Allah will provide him with His shadow. I said to him: My uncle, if you take the cloak of your servant and you give him your two garments, or take his two garments of Ma'afir and give him your cloak, then there will be one dress for you and one for him.  He patched my head and said; O Allah, bless the son of my brother. O son of my brother, I saw with my very eyes, I heard with my very ears and it was lodged in this heart of mine, and he pointed towards his heart, that Allah's Apostle (peace be upon him) said: Feed them (the servants) with and clothe them (the servants) with what you wear.

Allah's Apostle (peace be upon him) came to us in this very mosque and he had in his hand the twig of the palm-tree. He saw some mucus in the direction of the Qiblah of the mosque so he erased it with the help of the twig.  He then came to us and said: Which of you wants Allah to turn His face away from him? We were afraid. He then again said: Which of you wants Allah to turn His face away from him? We were afraid. He again said: Which of you wants Allah should turn His face away from him?  We said: Allah's Apostle, none of us wants that. He said: If one of you stands for prayer, Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, is before him. Therefore he should not spit in front of him, or on his right, but should spit on his left beneath his left foot. If he is impelled to do so all of a sudden (in spite of himself) he should then spit in his cloth and fold it in some part of it. (He continued): Bring some perfume. A young man, who belonged to our tribe, stood up, went and brought some scent in his palm. Allah's Apostle (peace be upon him) took it, applied it to the end of the twig and then touched the place where there had been mucus. Jabir said: This is why you should apply to your mosques.

We set out along with Allah's Apostle (peace be upon him) on an expedition of Batn Buwat. He (the Holy Prophet) was in search of al-Majdi ibn Amr al-Juhani. (We had such meagre equipment) that five, six or seven of us had one camel to ride and so we rode it in turn. Once it was the turn of an Ansari to ride the camel. He made it kneel down in order to mount it (and after having mounted it), he tried to make it rise but it hesitated.  So he said: May there be the curse of Allah upon you!  Thereupon Allah's Apostle (peace be upon him) said: Who is that cursing his camel?  He said: Allah's Apostle (peace be upon him) it is I.  Thereupon he said: Dismount from the camel and let us not have in our company the one who curses. Don't curse yourselves, nor your children, nor your belongings. There is the possibility that your curse may synchronise with the time when Allah is about to confer upon you what you demand and thus your prayer may be readily answered.

We set out on an expedition with Allah's Apostle (peace be upon him) until it was evening, and we were near a water reservoir of Arabia.  Allah's Apostle (peace be upon him) said: Who will be the one to go ahead, set right the reservoir, drink water himself and serve us with it? Jabir said: I stood up and said: Allah's Apostle (peace be upon him) I am ready to do that.  Thereupon Allah's Apostle (peace be upon him) said: Who is the person to accompany Jabir? Then Jabbar ibn Sakhr stood up. So we went to the well, poured a bucket or two of water in the reservoir, plastered it with clay and then began to fill it (with water) until it was filled to the brim.  Allah's Apostle (peace be upon him) was the first to appear before us, and he said: Do you (both) permit me to drink water from it?  We said: Yes, Allah's Apostle. He led his camel to drink water and it drank. He then pulled its rein and it stretched its legs and began to urinate. So he took it aside, made it kneel down somewhere else then came to the reservoir and performed ablution. I then stood up and performed ablution in the same way as Allah's Apostle (peace be upon him). Jabbar ibn Sakhr went off in order to relieve himself while Allah's Apostle (peace be upon him) stood up to observe prayer.   I was wearing a mantle; I tried to invert its ends but it was too short (to cover my body easily). It had a border. I then inverted it (the mantle) and drew the ends together and then tied them round my neck. I then came and stood on the left side of Allah's Apostle (peace be upon him). He caught hold of me and made me go round behind him, until he made me stand on his right side. Then Jabbar ibn Sakhr came. He performed ablution and then came and stood on the left side of Allah's Apostle (peace be upon him). Allah's Apostle (peace be upon him) caught hold of our hands together, pushed us back and made us stand behind him. Then Allah's Apostle (peace be upon him) began to give me fleeting glance, but I did not perceive that. When I became aware of it, he indicated with gesture of his hand that I should wrap my loin-cloth.  When Allah's Apostle (peace be upon him) had finished the prayer, he said: Jabir!  I said: Allah's Apostle (peace be upon him), I am at thy beck and call.  He said: When the cloth around you is inadequate, then tie the  ends together, but when it is small, tie it round the lower part of body.

We set out on an expedition with Allah's Apostle (peace be upon him) and the only means of sustenance for each one of us was just one date per day so we used to chew it. We beat down the leaves with the help of our bows and ate them until the sides of our mouths were sore. It so happened one day that someone was overlooked and not given a date. We carried that person and bore witness to the fact that he had not been given the date so he was offered it and he stood up to receive it.

We set out on an expedition along with Allah's Apostle (peace be upon him) until we dismounted in a spacious valley. Allah's Apostle (peace be upon him) went to relieve himself and I followed him with a bucket full of water but Allah's Apostle (peace be upon him) looked about but he found no privacy except for two trees at the end of the valley. Allah's Apostle (peace be upon him) went to one of them, took hold of one of its twigs and said: Be thou under my control by the permission of Allah; so it came under his control like the camel who has its nose-string in the hand of its rider. Then he came to the second tree and took hold of a twig and said: Be thou under my control with the permission of Allah; and it came under his control. When he stood between the two trees he joined together the two twigs and said: Join with the permission of Allah.  Jabir said: I was afraid lest Allah's Apostle (peace be upon him) should be aware of my presence and go still farther. Muhammad ibn Abbad used the word -----and I began to talk to myself. As I looked, I suddenly found Allah's Apostle (peace be upon him) before me and the two trees were separated, each one of them standing in its place. I saw Allah's Apostle (peace be upon him) standing for a short time, nodding his head right and left. Isma'il pointed towards the right and left with the help of his head (in order to demonstrate) how the Holy Prophet had pointed).  Then he (the Holy Prophet) came to me and said: Jabir, did you see the place where I was standing?  I said: Allah's Apostle (peace be upon him), Yes.  He then said: Then you should go to those two trees and cut a twig from each of them. Then take then to the place where I was standing stand there where I was standing and place a twig on the right and a twig on the left. Jabir said: I set out and took hold of a stone, broke it and sharpened it, then I came to those trees and cut a twig from each one of them. I then brought them until I stood at the place where Allah's Apostle (peace be upon him) had been standing and placed a twig on the right and a twig on the left.  Then I met him and said: Allah's Apostle (peace be upon him) I have done that, but (kindly) explain to me the reason for it.  Thereupon he said: I passed by two graves the occupants of which had been undergoing torment. I liked to make intercession for them so that they might be relieved of the torment as long as these twigs remain fresh.  Jabir said: We came back to the (camp of the) army and Allah's Apostle (peace be upon him) said: Jabir, call the people to perform wudu.  I cried: Come and perform wudu , come and perform wudu, come and perform wudu. I said: Allah's Apostle (peace be upon him) there is not even a drop of water in the army camp. There was a person who used to cool the water for Allah's Apostle in the old water-skin which was hung on a branch twig. He asked me to go to a certain Ansari and ask him to see if there were. any water in that skin. I went to him and cast a glance in it but did not find anything but a drop in the mouth of that water-skin and if I were to draw that, the water-skin's dried part would suck it up.  I came to Allah's Apostle (peace be upon him) and said: Allah's Apostle, I have not found anything in it but a drop of water in the mouth of the water-skin and now if I were to draw that, it would be absorbed.  He said: Go and bring that to me. I brought it to him. He took hold of it, began to utter something which I could not understand, then pressed it with his hand gave it to me and said: Jabir, announce the tub to be brought. So I announced the tub of the army (to be brought). It was brought accordingly and I placed it before him (the Holy Prophet).  Thereupon Allah's Apostle (peace be upon him) placed his hands in the tub like this, with his fingers outstretched, then he placed his fingers at the bottom of the tub and said: Jabir, take it (the water-skin) and pour water over me by reciting Bismillah.  So I poured water and I said: Bismillah, and found water out between the fingers of Allah's Apostle (peace be upon him).  Then that tub gushed forth until it was filled and the Apostle (peace be upon him) said: Jabir, make an announcement to the effect: He who needs water should take it.  Jabir said: The people came and took water until they were all satisfied.  I said: Is there anyone left who wants to take it? Allah's Apostle (peace be upon him) then lifted his hand from that tub and it was still full. Then the people made a complaint to Allah's Apostle (peace be upon him) about hunger and he said: May Allah provide you with food! We came to the shore of the ocean; There was a heavy swell and it cast ashore a big animal we lit, a fire, cooked it and helped ourselves until we had eaten to our heart's content.  Jabir said: About five people and myself entered its socket and nobody could see us until we had come out, and we took hold of one of its ribs and twisted it into a sort of arch. Then we called the tallest person in the army and the biggest camel of the army, with the the big saddle on its back, and it could easily pass through it without the rider needing to bend down.
