		<narration by="Mu'adh ibn Jabal"/>
		<p>
			I said to Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him): Inform me about
			an act which would entitle me to get into Paradise, and remove me
			away from Hell-Fire. He (the Prophet) said: You have asked me
			about a matter (which ostensibly appears to be) difficult but it
			is easy to those for whom Allah, the Exalted, has made it easy.
			Worship Allah and do not associate anything with him, establish
			prayer, pay the Zakat, observe the fast of Ramadan and perform
			Hajj to the (sacred) House (Ka'bah). He again said: Should I not
			direct you to the gateways of good? Listen to me: The fasting is
			a shield against evil, the charity extinguishes (the fire of sin)
			just as water  extinguishes fire, the prayer of a person during
			the middle of the night. Then he recited: 'Who forsake their
			beds...(up to)....they used to do.' Then he said: Should I not
			direct you to the highest level of this matter, to the pillar on
			which (it rests) and its top? I said: Allah's Messenger yes, (do
			tell me). He said: The uppermost level of the matter is al-Islam.
			Its pillar is the prayer and its top is Jihad. He then said:
			Should I not inform you of the sheet anchor of all this? I said:
			Allah's Apostle (of course do it). He took hold of his tongue and
			said: Exercise restraint on it. I said: Apostle of Allah, would
			we be held responsible for what we say with it? Thereupon he
			said: Mu'adh, may your mother be bereaved. Will anything else
			besides (irresponsible) talk cause the people to be thrown into
			the Hell-Fire upon their faces or on their nostrils?

		<narration by="Uthman ibn Affan"/>
		<p>
			When the Prophet (peace be upon him be upon  him) died, some of
			his companions were so much aggrieved (at his death) that they
			were disposed to doubts. Uthman said: I was one of them.  While I
			was sitting there happened to pass by me Umar and he offered me
			salutation  which I did not notice. Umar made a complaint of that
			to AbuBakr. Then both of them came and offered me salutation and
			AbuBakr said: What prompted you to ignore the salutation of your
			brother, Umar. I said: I never did that. Umar said: By Allah, of
			course you did that. I said: By Allah I did not perceive that you
			passed by me and paid salutation. AbuBakr said: Uthman is
			speaking the truth and something must have absorbed your mind
			(that you did not take notice of this matter). I said: Yes it is
			so. He said: What is that? I said: Allah has taken away His
			Prophet (peace and blessing of Allah be upon him) before we asked
			him how we could free ourselves from the snares of the world and
			the devil. AbuBakr said: I did ask about that. So I got near to
			him and said to him: May my father and mother be taken as ransom
			for you and you were the worthiest to ask. Thereupon AbuBakr
			said: I said to Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him), how one
			could free oneself from the snares of the world and devil.
			Thereupon Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him) said: He who
			accepted from me the word that I  presented to my uncle which he
			rejected is the freedom (from them) (Affirmation of the oneness
			of Allah and the Apostlehood of Muhammad).

			to your parents even if they command you to abandon your family

			deliberately will become out of the protection of Allah. 4. Do
			not drink wine for it is the height of every obscenity. 5. Shun
			evil, for with evil there descends the wrath of Allah. 6. Beware

			7. And when the death overtakes the people (in a plague or

			Spend on your children according to your means. 9. Do not refrain

			Be careful and follow Allah's commands perseveringly. Allah will

			need help, solicit Allah alone for the same. Bear it in mind that

			Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him) said, Satan exercises his
			influence upon the son of Adam and so does the angel exercise his
			influence (upon him). The influence of Satan is that he holds the
			promise of evil and denial of truth. And the influence of the
			angel is that he holds the promise of good and the affirmation of
			truth. Thus he who perceives this (i.e. good promise) he should
			praise Allah and he who finds contrary to it, he should seek
			refuge with Allah from Satan, the accursed. He then recited this
			verse: `Satan threatens you with the prospect of poverty and bids
			you to be indecent.' (2:268)

			Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him)  went out and he had in his

			us. Thereupon he said: This one which my right hand possesses is
			a Book from the Lord of the worlds. It contains the names of the

			of their tribes. It is most exhaustive and nothing will be added
			to it nor anything eliminated from it up to eternity. He then
			said: This one in my left  hand is a Book from the Lord of the

			exhaustive to the end and nothing will be added to it nor

			Allah's Apostle (peace be upon him) said: Allah made covenant
			(with the whole of mankind) while creating it from Adam's back in
			Na'man i.e. Arafah and emitting from his loins all his offspring
			that He created and scattering them before Him like ant. He then
			spoke to them in their presence and said: `Am I not your Lord?
			They answered: Yes, we do bear witness thereto (of this We remind
			you) lest you say on the Day of Resurrection: Verily, we were
			unaware of this. Or lest you say: Verily, these were our
			forefathers in times gone by, who began to ascribe divinity to
			other things besides Allah and we were but their late offspring.
			Wilt Thou then destroy us for doings of those inventors of
			falsehood.' (7:172-173)

			In regard to the words of Allah, the Exalted and Glorious, "Your
			Lord brought forth their offspring from the loins of the children
			of Adam." (7:172) Ubayy said: He gathered them and paired them
			then fashioned them  and endowed them with the power of speech
			and they began to speak. He then  made an agreement and covenant
			with them. He made them bear witness about themselves (saying) Am
			I not your Lord. They said: Yes. He said: I call to witness seven
			heavens and seven earths regarding you and I call witness your
			father Adam regarding you lest you should say on the Day of
			Resurrection: We do not know this. Bear this in mind that there
			is no god besides Me and there is no Lord besides Me and do not
			associate anything with Me. It is I Who should be sending to you
			My messengers in order to remind you  My agreement and My
			covenant and it is I who would send you My Books. They	said: We
			bear witness to the fact that Thou art our Lord, Thou art our
			Object of worship. There is no Lord besides Thee and there is no
			object of worship  besides Thee. They confirmed this (pledge).
			Adam was raised above them so that he would see them and he saw
			the rich and the poor, those having handsome faces and even those
			inferior to them and he said: My Lord, why is it that Thou hast
			not made Thy servants alike? He said: I wish that I should be
			thanked. And he also saw the Prophets, some amongst them like
			lamps with light in them, distinguished by another covenant
			regarding messengership and  prophethood, viz. the words of the
			Blessed and the High: And when We made covenant with the prophets
			- up to His words: Jesus son of Mary (33:7). He was among those
			spirits and He sent him to Mary (peace be upon both of them). And
			 it is narrated by Ubayy that he entered by her mouth.

			there is no god but Allah and that Muhammad is His Messenger and

			Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him) said in a sermon which he

			blessed month, a month containing a night which is better than a
			thousand months has approached you people. Allah has appointed
			the observance of fasting during it as an obligatory duty, and
			the passing of its night in prayer as a voluntary practice. If
			someone draws near to Allah during it with some good act he will
			be like one who fulfils an obligatory duty in another month, and
			he who fulfils an obligatory duty in it will be like one who
			fulfils seventy obligatory duties in another month. It is the
			month of endurance and the reward of endurance is Paradise. It is
			the month of sharing with others, and a month in which the
			believer's provision is increased. If someone gives one who has
			been fasting something with which to break his fast it will
			provide forgiveness of his sins and save him from Hell, and he
			will have a reward equal to his without his reward being
			diminished in any respect." We remarked to Allah's Messenger
			(peace be upon him) that not all of us have the means to give one
			who had been fasting something with which to break his fast. He
			replied, "Allah gives this reward to him who gives one who has
			been fasting some milk mixed with water, or a date, or a drink of
			water with which to break his fast. Anyone who gives a full meal
			to one who has been fasting will be given a drink from my tank
			(Hawd) by Allah and will not thirst till he enters Paradise. It
			is a month whose beginning is mercy, whose middle is forgiveness,
			and whose end is freedom from Hell. If anyone makes things easy
			for his slave during it, Allah will forgive him and free him from
			Hell."

			When Ma'iz al-Aslami came to Allah's Messenger (peace be upon

			passed a man who had the jawbone of a camel, with which he struck

		<p>
			Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him) stood up among us to
			deliver an address after the afternoon prayer, and he did not
			leave out anything that would happen up to the Day of
			Resurrection without mentioning it. Some remembered and some
			forgot his words. In the course of his address he said, "The
			world is sweet and verdant and Allah is putting you as successors
			in it, so consider how you act. Be on you guard against the
			world, and be on your guard against women." He mentioned that
			everyone who had betrayed a trust would have a banner on the Day
			of Resurrection to the extent of his betrayal in the world, and
			that no betrayal was greater than that of  the ruler of the
			common people, whose banner would be fixed onto his posterior. 
			And he said, "Let not respect for men prevent any of you from
			speaking the truth when he knows it." One version says "From
			changing a disreputable thing if he sees it." AbuSa'id then wept
			and said: We have seen it, but respect for men has prevented us
			from speaking about it. The Prophet then said, "The descendants
			of Adam have been created in various categories. Some are born 
			believers and live and die believers; some are born infidels and
			live and die  infidels; some are born believers and live as
			believers, but die infidels; some are born infidels and live as
			infidels, but die believers." It is said that he mentioned anger,
			saying, "Some are swift to anger and swift to cool down, the one
			characteristic making up for the other; some are slow to anger
			and slow to cool down, the one characteristic making up for the
			other; but the best of you are those who are slow to anger and
			swift to cool down, and the  worst of you are those who are swift
			to anger and slow to cool down." He continued, "Beware of anger,
			for it is a live coal on the heart of the descendant of Adam. Do
			you not notice the swelling of the veins of his neck and the
			redness  of his eyes? So when anyone experiences anything of that
			nature he should lie down and cleave to the earth." The Prophet
			(peace be upon him) mentioned debts saying, "Some among you are
			good payers, but make immoderate demands when a debt is owed to 
			them, the one characteristic making up for the other. Some are
			bad payers, but make gentle demands when a debt is owed to them,
			the one characteristic making up for the other. But the best
			among you are those who are good payers when they owe a debt and
			make gentle demands when a debt is owed to them, and the worst
			among you are those who are bad payers when they owe a debt and
			make immoderate demands when a debt is owed to them." Then when
			the sun was shining over the tops of the palm trees and the
			extremities of the walls he said, "No more of the world remains
			in relation to what has passed than there remains of this day in

			Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him) said, "There are three

			will give him greater honour on that account; and that when a man
			opens a door towards begging Allah opens for him a door towards
			poverty. The thing I am going to tell you which you must keep in
			mind is this. The world has only four types of people: 1) A man
			whom Allah provides with property and knowledge, in which he
			fears his Lord and joins ties of relationship, acting in it
			towards Allah as is due to Him, this man being in the most
			excellent station. 2) A man whom Allah provides with knowledge
			but not with property, who says with a sincere intention that if
			he had property he would act as so and so does, their reward
			being equal. 3) A man whom Allah provides with property but not
			with knowledge, in which he acts in a random manner ignorantly,
			not fearing his Lord respecting it, or using it to join ties of
			relationship, or dealing with it in a right way, this man being
			in the worst station. 4) A man whom Allah provides with neither
			property nor knowledge, who says that if he had property he would
			deal with it as so and so does and has this intention, the load

		<p>
			Sa'id ibn al-Musayyab met AbuHurayrah who said, "I ask Allah to

			contained a market and he replied that it did, for Allah's
			Messenger (peace be upon him) had informed him that when the
			inhabitants of Paradise will enter it they will alight in it by
			virtue of their deeds. They will then be granted permission for
			the period of a Friday in this world and will visit their Lord
			whose throne will be shown to them, and He will appear to them in
			one of the gardens of Paradise. Pulpits of light, pulpits of
			pearls, pulpits of rubies, pulpits of chrysoprase, pulpits of
			gold and pulpits of silver will be placed for them, and the
			humblest of them, for there would be no one worthless among them,
			will sit on mounds of musk and camphor, not considering that
			those who are on the chairs are in a more excellent position than
			they. AbuHurayrah told that he asked, "Messenger of Allah (peace
			be upon him) shall we see our Lord?" To which he replied, "Yes,
			are you in doubt about seeing the sun and the moon on the night
			when it is full?" On receiving the reply that they were not, he

			Lord, and no man will remain in that assembly without Allah
			conversing with him, till he says to one of them, 'So and so, son
			of so and so, do you remember the day you said such and such?'
			and He will remind him of one of the dishonest things he did in
			the world. He will say, 'O my Lord, hast Thou not forgiven me?
			And He will reply, 'Yes; by the breadth of my forgiveness you
			have reached this station of yours.' While that is taking place a
			cloud will overshadow them from above and rain on them perfume
			whose fragrance will be such as they have never experienced
			anything to compare with, and our Lord will say, 'Stand up and go
			to the honour I have prepared for you, and take what you desire.'
			We shall then come to a market surrounded by angels, containing
			such things as eyes have never seen, ears have never heard, and
			hearts have never thought of. What we desire will be conveyed to
			us, there being no buying or selling in it, and in that market
			the inhabitants of Paradise will meet one another. A man of
			exalted station will come forward and meet one who is humbler
			than him, though there would be no one worthless among them, who
			will be charmed by the clothing he sees him wearing, but before
			their talk comes to an end he will imagine that he has something
			more beautiful than the other. That is because it is not
			appropriate for anyone to grieve in it. We shall then go to our
			dwellings and our wives will meet us and say, 'Welcome; you have
			come with more excellent beauty than you had when you left us.'
			We shall reply, 'To-day we have had a meeting with our Lord, the
			Overpowering One, and it is fitting that we should come away as

			"Those who are to go to Paradise, who die whether young or old,

			Allah's Messenger (peace be upon him) said, "Hunger will be cast
			upon the inhabitants of Hell and will be equal to the punishment
			they are experiencing. They will cry for help and will be helped
			with food of dari' which neither fattens nor satisfies hunger.
			They will then call for food and will be fed with food which
			chokes. So remembering that they helped down choking food with
			drink when they were in the world they will ask for drink and the
			scalding drink will be presented to them on iron flesh-hooks.
			When these approach their faces they will scorch their faces, and
			then they enter their bellies they will cut in pieces the
			contents of their bellies. They will then ask the guards of
			Jahannam to be called who will say, 'Did your messengers not
			bring you the clear signs?' and when they reply, 'Yes,' they will
			say, 'Then make supplication, but the supplication of the
			infidels is only in error.' They will then ask Malik to be called
			and will say, 'O Malik, would that your Lord might put an end to
			us!' He will reply to them, 'You are remaining' (al-A'mash saying
			he had been informed that the period between their appeal and
			Malik's reply to them would be a thousand years). They will then
			say, "Call your Lord, for no one is better than your Lord,' and
			they will say, 'O our Lord, our adversity was too much for us and
			we were a people who went astray. O our Lord, bring us out of it;
			then if we return to evil we shall indeed be wrongdoers.' He will
			then answer them, 'Retreat into it in shame and do not speak to
			me.' They will then despair of all good and will begin to sigh,
			grieve and bemoan themselves." Abdullah ibn AbdurRahman said that
			people do not trace this tradition back to the Prophet.
