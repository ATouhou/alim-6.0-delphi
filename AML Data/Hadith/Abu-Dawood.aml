			he has done well; if not, there is no harm. If anyone goes to
			relieve himself, he should conceal himself, and if all he can do
			is to collect a heap of send, he should sit with his back to it,

			Adam. If he does so, he has done well; but if not, there is no

			she had company with me and I have children from her. He said:
			Then ask her (to obey you). If there is something good in her,
			she will do so (obey); and do not beat your wife as you beat your

			We observed the prayer after nightfall with the Apostle of Allah
			(peace be upon him), and he did not come out till about half the
			night had passed. He then said: Take your places. We then took
			our places. Then he said: The people have prayed and gone to bed,

			AbuMuhammad fancies that witr prayer is essential. (Hearing this)

			observes perfectly their bowing and submissiveness in them, it is

			people told him: Hoist a flag at the time of prayer; when they
			see it, they will inform one another. But he (the Prophet) did
			not like it. Then someone mentioned to him the horn.  Ziyad said:
			A horn of the Jews. He (the Prophet) did not like it. He said:
			This is the matter of the Jews. Then they mentioned to him the
			bell of the Christians.  He said: This is the matter of the

			because of the anxiety of the Apostle (peace be upon him). He was
			then taught the call to prayer in his dream. Next day he came to
			the Apostle of Allah (peace be upon him) and informed him about
			it.  He said: Apostle of Allah, I was between sleep and
			wakefulness; all of a sudden a newcomer came (to me) and taught
			me the call to prayer. Umar ibn al-Khattab had also seen it in
			his dream before, but he kept it hidden for twenty days.  The
			Prophet (peace be upon him) said to me (Umar): What did prevent
			you from saying it to me?  He said: Abdullah ibn Zayd had already
			told you about it before me: hence I was ashamed.  Then the
			Apostle of Allah (peace be upon him) said: Bilal, stand up, see
			what Abdullah ibn Zayd tells you (to do), then do it. Bilal then
			called them to prayer.	AbuBishr reported on the authority of

			Prayer passed through three stages and fasting also passed
			through three stages. The narrator Nasr reported the rest of the
			tradition completely. The narrator, Ibn al-Muthanna, narrated the
			story of saying prayer facing in the direction of Jerusalem.  He
			said: The third stage is that the Apostle of Allah (peace be upon
			him) came to Medina and prayed, i.e. facing Jerusalem, for
			thirteen months.  Then Allah, the Exalted, revealed the verse:
			"We have seen thee turning thy face to Heaven (for guidance, O
			Muhammad). And now verily We shall make thee turn (in prayer)
			toward a qiblah which is dear to thee. So turn thy face toward
			the Inviolable Place of Worship, and ye (O Muslims), wherever ye
			may be, turn your face (when ye pray) toward it" (ii.144). And
			Allah, the Reverend and the Majestic, turned (them) towards the
			Ka'bah. He (the narrator) completed his tradition.  The narrator,
			Nasr, mentioned the name of the person who had the dream, saying:
			And Abdullah ibn Zayd, a man from the Ansar, came. The same
			version reads: And he turned his face towards the qiblah and
			said: Allah is most great, Allah is most great; I testify that
			there is no god but Allah, I testify that there is no god but
			Allah; I testify that Muhammad is the Apostle of Allah, I testify
			that Muhammad is the Apostle of Allah; come to prayer (he
			pronounced it twice), come to salvation (he pronounced it twice);
			Allah is Most Great, Allah is most great. He then paused for a
			while, and then got up and pronounced in a similar way, except
			that after the phrase "Come to salvation" he added. "The time for
			prayer has come, the time for prayer has come."  The Apostle of
			Allah (peace be upon him) said: Teach it to Bilal, then pronounce
			the adhan (call to prayer) with the same words. As regards
			fasting, he said: The Apostle of Allah (peace be upon him) used
			to fast for three days every month, and would fast on the tenth
			of Muharram. Then Allah, the Exalted, revealed the verse:
			".......Fasting was prescribed for those before you, that ye may
			ward off (evil)......and for those who can afford it there is a
			ransom: the feeding of a man in need (ii.183-84). If someone
			wished to keep the fast, he would keep the fast; if someone
			wished to abandon the fast, he would feed an indigent every day;
			it would do for him. But this was changed. Allah, the Exalted,
			revealed: "The month of Ramadan in which was revealed the Qur'an
			..........(let him fast the same) number of other days" (ii.185).
			 Hence the fast was prescribed for the one who was present in the
			month (of Ramadan) and the traveller was required to atone (for
			them); feeding (the indigent) was prescribed for the old man and
			woman who were unable to fast. (The narrator, Nasr, further
			reported): The companion Sirmah, came after finishing his day's
			work......and he narrated the rest of the tradition.

			The words of adhan were pronounced from the time of the Apostle

			come" would be pronounced twice. When we heard iqamah, we would

			will be like that of one who goes for hajj pilgrimage after

			accepted, on it he died, and on it the Last Hour will take place.
			On Friday every beast is on the lookout from dawn to sunrise in
			fear of the Last Hour, but not jinn and men, and it contains a
			time at which no Muslim prays and asks anything from Allah but He
			will give it to him.  Ka'b said: That is one day every year.  So
			I said: It is on every Friday.	Ka'b read the Torah and said: The

			AbuHurayrah said: I met Abdullah ibn Salam and told him of my

			 When a man sits in a place where he can listen (to the sermon)

			interrupt, he will receive a double reward. If he stays away,
			sits in a place where he cannot listen (to the sermon), silent,

			and they also bowed, and then he prostrated himself and they also

			prostration and they also prostrated with him as quickly as

			then stop praying when the sun is rising till it has reached the
			height of one or two lances, for it rises between the two horns

			verse: "He knoweth that ye count it not, and turneth unto you in
			mercy. Recite then of the Qur'an that which is easy for you"
			(v.20). The phrase "the vigil of the night" (nashi'at al-layl)
			means the early hours of the night. They (the companions) would
			pray (the tahajjud prayer) in the early hours of the night.  He
			(Ibn Abbas) says: It is advisable to offer the prayer at night
			(tahajjud), prescribed by Allah for you (in the early hours of
			the night). This is because when a person sleeps, he does not
			know when he will awake. The words "speech more certain" (aqwamu
			qilan) means that this time is more suitable for the

			his family (in his house) and pray four rak'ahs. Then he would go
			to his bed and sleep, but the water for his ablution was placed
			covered near his head and his tooth-stick was also kept there
			until Allah awakened him at night.  He then used the tooth-stick,
			performed ablution perfectly then came to the place of prayer and
			would pray eight rak'ahs, in which he would recite Surah
			al-Fatihah, and a surah from the Qur'an as Allah willed. He would
			not sit during any of them but sit after the eighth rak'ah, and
			would not utter the salutation, but recite (the Qur'an) during
			the ninth rak'ah. Then he would sit and supplicate as long as
			Allah willed, and beg Him and devote his attention to Him; He
			would utter the salutation once in such a loud voice that the
			inmates of the house were almost awakened by his loud salutation.
			He would then recite Surah al-Fatihah while sitting, bow while
			sitting, and then recite the Qur'an during the second rak'ah, and
			would bow and prostrate while sitting. He would supplicate Allah
			as long as He willed, then utter the salutation and turn away. 
			This amount of prayer of the Apostle of Allah (peace be upon him)
			continued till he put a weight. During that period he retrenched
			two rak'ahs from nine and began to pray six and seven rak'ahs
			standing and two rak'ahs sitting. This continued till he died.

		<p>
			The Apostle of Allah (peace be upon him) heard a person
			supplicating during prayer. He did not mention the greatness of
			Allah, nor did he invoke blessings on the Prophet (peace be upon
			him). The Apostle of Allah (peace be upon him) said: He made
			haste. He then called him and said either to him or to any other
			person: If any of you prays, he should mention the exaltation of
			his Lord in the beginning and praise Him; he should then invoke
			blessings on the Prophet (peace be upon him); thereafter he
			should supplicate Allah for anything he wishes.

	<hadith num="624">
		<narration by="Abdullah ibn Umar"/>
		<p>
			The Apostle of Allah (peace be upon him) wrote a letter about
			sadaqah (zakat) but he died before he could send it to his
			governors. He had kept it  with his sword. So AbuBakr acted upon
			it till he died, and then Umar acted upon it till he died.  It
			contained: "For five camels one goat is to be given; for ten
			camels two goats are to be given; for fifteen camels three goats
			are to be given; for twenty camels four goats are to be given;
			for twenty-five to thirty-five camels a she-camel in her second
			year is to be given. If the number exceeds by one up to seventy
			camels, a she-camel in her fourth year is to be given; if they
			exceed by one up to seventy-five camels, a she-camel in her fifth
			year is to be given; if they exceed by one up to ninety camels,
			two she-camels in their third year are to be given; if they
			exceed by one up to one hundred and twenty, two she-camels in
			their fourth year are to be given. If the camels are more than
			this, a she-camel in her fourth year is to be given for every
			fifty camels, and a she-camel in her third year is to be given
			for every forty camels.  For forty to one hundred and twenty
			goats one goat is to be given; if they exceed by one up to two
			hundred, two goats are to be given. If they exceed by one up to
			three hundred, three goats are to be given; if the goats are more
			than this, one goat for every hundred goats is to be given.
			Nothing is payable until they reach one hundred. Those which are
			in one flock are not to be separated, and those which are in
			separate flocks are not be brought together from fear of sadaqah
			(zakat). Regarding that which belongs to two partners, they can
			make claims for restitution from each other with equity. An old
			goat and a defective one are not to be accepted as sadaqah
			(zakat)."  Az-Zuhri said: When the collector comes, the goats
			will be apportioned into three flocks: one containing bad, the
			second good, and the third moderate. The collector will take
			zakat from the moderate. Az-Zuhri did not mention the cows (to be
			apportioned in three flocks).
		</p>
	</hadith>
	<hadith num="625">
		<narration by="Ali ibn AbuTalib"/>
		<p>
			Al-Harith al-A'war reported from Ali. Zuhayr said: I think, the
			Prophet (peace be upon him) said: "Pay a fortieth. A dirham is
			payable on every forty, but you are not liable for payment until
			you have accumulated two hundred dirhams. When you have two
			hundred dirhams, five dirhams are payable, and that proportion is
			applicable to larger amounts.  "Regarding sheep, for every forty
			sheep up to one hundred and twenty, one sheep is due. But if you
			possess only thirty-nine, nothing is payable on them." He further
			narrated the tradition about the sadaqah (zakat) on sheep like
			that of az-Zuhri.  "Regarding cattle, a yearling bull calf is
			payable for every thirty, and a cow in her third year for forty,
			and nothing is payable on working animals.  Regarding (the zakat
			on) camels, he mentioned the rates that az-Zuhri mentioned in his
			tradition. He said: "For twenty-five camels, five sheep are to be
			paid. If they exceed by one, a she-camel in her second year is to
			be given. If there is no she-camel in her second year, a male
			camel in its third year is to be given, up to thirty-five. If
			they exceed by one a she-camel in her third year is to be given,
			up to forty-five. If they exceed by one, a she-camel in her
			fourth year which is ready to be covered by a bull-camel is to be
			given." He then transmitted the rest of the tradition like that
			of az-Zuhri.  He continued: If they exceed by one, i.e. they are
			ninety-one to hundred and twenty, two she-camels in their fourth
			year, which are ready to be covered by a bull-camel, are to be
			given. If there are more camels than that, a she-camel in her
			fourth year is to be given for every fifty. Those which are in
			one flock are not to be separated, and those which are separate
			are not to be brought together. An old sheep, one with a defect
			in the eye, or a billy goat is not to be accepted as a sadaqah
			unless the collector is willing.  As regards agricultural
			produce, a tenth is payable on that which is watered by rivers or
			rain, and a twentieth on that which is watered by draught
			camels."  The version of Asim and al-Harith says: "Sadaqah
			(zakat) is payable every year." Zuhayr said: I think he said
			"Once a year".	The version of Asim has the words: "If a
			she-camel in her second year is not available among the camels,
			nor is there a bull-camel in its third year, ten dirhams or two
			goats are to be given."

			The Prophet (peace be upon him) said: "When you possess two

			year passes on them, half a dinar is payable. Whatever exceeds,
			that will be reckoned properly." (The narrator said: I do not
			remember whether the words "that will be reckoned properly" were

			When this verse was revealed: "And those who hoard gold and

			dispel your care. He, therefore, went and said: Prophet of Allah,
			your Companions were grieved by this verse. The Apostle of Allah
			(peace be upon him) said: Allah has made zakat obligatory simply
			to purify your remaining property, and He made inheritances
			obligatory that they might come to those who survive you. Umar
			then said: Allah is most great. He then said to him: Let me
			inform you about the best a man hoards; it is a virtuous woman
			who pleases him when he looks at her, obeys him when he gives her

			it obligatory.	He replied: I am aware of it more than the
			people. The Apostle of Allah (peace be upon him) performed only
			one hajj. Hence the people differed among themselves. The Apostle
			of Allah (peace be upon him) came out (from Medina) with the
			intention of performing hajj. When he offered two rak'ahs of
			prayer in the mosque at Dhul-Hulayfah, he made it obligatory by
			wearing it.  At the same meeting, he raised his voice in the

			she-camel), and when it (the she-camel) stood up, with him on its
			back, he raised his voice in the talbiyah and some people heard
			it at that moment. This is because the people were coming in
			groups, so they heard him raising his voice calling the talbiyah
			when his she-camel stood up with him on its back, and they
			thought that the Apostle of Allah (peace be upon him) had raised
			his voice in the talbiyah when his she-camel stood up with him on
			its back.  The Apostle of Allah (peace be upon him) proceeded
			further; when he ascended the height of al-Bayda' he raised his
			voice in the talbiyah. Some people heard it at that moment. They
			thought that he had raised his voice in the talbiyah when he
			ascended the height of al-Bayda'. I swear by Allah, he raised his
			voice in the talbiyah at the place where he prayed, and he raised
			his voice in the talbiyah when his she-camel stood up with him on
			its back, and he raised his voice in the talbiyah when he
			ascended the height of al-Bayda'.  Sa'id (ibn Jubayr) said; He
			who follows the view of Ibn Abbas raises his voice in talbiyah

			who believes in Allah and the last day to water what another has
			sown with his water (meaning intercourse with women who are
			pregnant); it is not lawful for a man who believes in Allah and
			the Last Day to have intercourse with a captive woman till she is
			free from a menstrual course; and it is not lawful for a man who
			believes in Allah and the Last Day to sell spoil till it is
			divided.

		<narration by="Abdullah Ibn Abbas"/>
		<p>
			Ibn Umar misunderstood (the Qur'anic verse, "So come to your
			tilth however you will")--may Allah forgive him. The fact is that
			this clan of the Ansar, who were idolaters, lived in the company
			of the Jews who were the people of the Book. They (the Ansar)
			accepted their superiority over themselves in respect of
			knowledge, and they followed most of their actions. The people of
			the Book (i.e. the Jews) used to have intercourse with their
			women on one side alone (i.e. lying on their backs). This was the
			most concealing position for (the vagina of) the women. This clan
			of the Ansar adopted this practice from them. But this tribe of
			the Quraysh used to uncover their women completely, and seek
			pleasure with them from in front and behind and laying them on
			their backs.  When the muhajirun (the immigrants) came to Medina,
			a man married a woman of the Ansar. He began to do the same kind
			of action with her, but she disliked it, and said to him: We were
			approached on one side (i.e. lying on the back); do it so,
			otherwise keep away from me. This matter of theirs spread widely,
			and it reached the Apostle of Allah (peace be upon him).  So
			Allah, the Exalted, sent down the Qur'anic verse: "Your wives are
			a tilth to you, so come to your tilth however you will," i.e.
			from in front, from behind or lying on the back. But this verse
			meant the place of the delivery of the child, i.e. the vagina.

			AbuNadrah reported: An old man of Tufawah said to me: I was a
			guest of AbuHurayrah at Medina. I did not find any one of the
			companions of the Prophet (peace be upon him) more devoted to
			worship and more hospitable than AbuHurayrah.  One day I was with
			him when he was sitting on his bed. He had a purse which
			contained pebbles or kernels. A black slave-girl of his was
			sitting below. Counting them he was glorifying Allah. When the
			pebbles or the kernels in the purse were finished, she gathered
			them and put them again in the purse, and gave it to him. He
			said: Should I not tell you about me and about the Apostle of
			Allah (peace be upon him)?  I said: Yes.  He said: Once when I
			was laid up with fever in the mosque, the Apostle of Allah (peace
			be upon him) came and entered the mosque, and said: Who saw the
			youth of ad-Daws. He said this three times.  A man said: Apostle
			of Allah, there he is, laid up with fever on one side of the
			mosque. He moved, walking forward till he reached me. He placed
			his hand on me. He had a kind talk with me, and I rose. He then
			began to walk till he reached the place where he used to offer
			his prayer. He paid his attention to the people. There were two
			rows of men and one row of women, or two rows of women and one
			row of men (the narrator is doubtful).	He then said: If Satan
			makes me forget anything during the prayer, the men should
			glorify Allah, and the women should clap their hands. The Apostle
			of Allah (peace be upon him) then prayed and he did not forget
			anything during the prayer.  He said: Be seated in your places,
			be seated in your places. The narrator, Musa, added the word
			"here". He then praised Allah and exalted Him, and said: Now to
			our topic.  The agreed version begins: He then said: Is there any
			man among you who approaches his wife, closes the door, covers
			himself with a curtain, and he is concealed with the curtain of
			Allah?	They replied: Yes.  He said: later he sits and says: I
			did so-and-so; I did so-and-so. The people kept silence. He then
			turned to the women and said (to them): Is there any woman among
			you who narrates it? They kept silence. Then a girl fell on one
			of her knees. The narrator, Mu'ammil, said in his version: a
			buxom girl. She raised her head before the Apostle of Allah
			(peace be upon him) so that he could see her and listen to her. 
			She said: Apostle of Allah, they (the men) describe the secrets
			(of intercourse) and they (the women) also describe the secrets
			(of intercourse) to the people.  He said: Do you know what the
			similitude is? He said: The likeness of this act is the likeness
			of a female Satan who meets the male Satan on the roadside; he
			fulfils his desire with her while the people are looking at him.
			Beware! The perfume of men is that whose smell becomes visible
			and its colour does not appear. Beware! The perfume of women is
			that whose colour becomes visible and whose smell is not obvious.
			 AbuDawud said: From here I remembered this tradition from
			Mu'ammil and Musa: Beware! No man should lie with another man, no
			woman should lie with another woman except with one's child or
			father. He also mentioned a third which I have forgotten. This
			has been mentioned in the version of Musaddad, but I do not
			remember it as precisely as I like.  The narrator, Musa, said:
			Hammad narrated this tradition from al-Jarir from AbuNadrah from

			upon him) came to himself (after the revelation ended), he said:
			Glad tidings for you, Hilal. Allah, the Exalted, has made it easy
			and, a way out for you.  Hilal said: I expected that from my
			Lord.  The Apostle of Allah (peace be upon him) said: Send for
			her. She then came. The Apostle of Allah (peace be upon him)
			recited (the verses) to them that the punishment in the next
			world was more severe than that in this world.	Hilal said: I
			swear by Allah, I spoke the truth against her. She said: He told
			a lie.	The Apostle of Allah (peace be upon him) said: Apply the
			method of invoking curses on each other. Hilal was told: Bear
			witness. So he bore witness before Allah four times that he spoke
			the truth.  When he was about to utter a fifth time, he was told:
			Hilal, fear Allah, for the punishment in this world is easier
			than that in the next world; and this is the deciding one that
			will surely cause punishment to you.  He said: I swear by Allah.
			Allah will not punish me for this (act), as He did not cause me
			to be flogged for this (act). So he bore witness a fifth time
			invoking the curse of Allah on him if he was one of those who
			told lies.  Then the people said to her: Testify. So she gave
			testimony before Allah that he was a liar.  When she was going to
			testify a fifth time, she was told: Fear Allah, for the
			punishment in this world is easier than that in the next world.
			This is the deciding one that will surely cause punishment to
			you.  She hesitated for a moment, and then said: By Allah, I
			shall not disgrace my people. So she testified a fifth time
			invoking the curse of Allah on her if he spoke the truth.  The
			Apostle of Allah (peace be upon him) separated them from each
			other, and decided that the child would not be attributed to its
			father. Neither she nor her child would be accused of adultery.
			He who accused her or her child would be liable to punishment. He
			also decided that there would be no dwelling and maintenance for
			her (from the husband), as they were separated without divorce. 
			He then said: If she gives birth to a child with reddish hair,
			light buttocks, wide belly and light shins, he will be the child
			of Hilal. If she bears a dusky child with curly hair, fat limbs,
			fat shins and fat buttock he will be the child of the one who was
			accused of adultery. She gave birth to a dusky child with curly
			hair, fat limbs, fat shins and fat buttocks.  The Apostle of
			Allah (peace be upon him) said: Had there been no oaths I should
			have dealt with her severely.  Ikrimah said: Later on he became
			the chief of the tribe of Mudar. He was not attributed to his
			father.

			expedition for Tabuk. I went to my family and then proceeded (on
			journey). The vanguard of the Companions of the Apostle of Allah
			(peace be upon him) had already proceeded. So I began to announce
			loudly in Medina: Is there anyone who takes a man on his ride,
			and he will get his share (from the booty? An old man from the
			Ansar (Helpers) spoke loudly: We shall have his share if we take
			him with us on our mount by turns, and he will have his meal with
			us. I said: Yes. He said: So go on journey with Allah's blessing.
			I then proceeded along with my best companion and Allah gave us
			booty. Some she-camels were given to me as my share of booty. I
			drove them till I reached him. He came out and sat on the rear
			part of the saddle of his camel. He then said: Drive them
			backward. He again said: Drive them forward. He then said: I find
			your she-camels very gentle. He said: This is your booty which I
			stipulated for you. He replied: Take your she-camels, my nephew;

			Apostle of Allah, you are the kindest of the people and the most
			skilled in matchmaking. Our fathers have nothing with which to

			before the battle of Badr.  (They wrote): You gave protection to

			fighters and appropriate your women.  When this (news) reached
			Abdullah ibn Ubayy and those who were worshippers of idols, with
			him they gathered together to fight the Apostle of Allah (peace
			be upon him).  When this news reached the Apostle of Allah (peace
			be upon him), he visited them and said: The threat of the Quraysh
			to you has reached its end. They cannot contrive a plot against
			you, greater than what you yourselves intended to harm you. Are
			you willing to fight your sons and brethren? When they heard this
			from the Prophet (peace be upon him), they scattered. This
			reached the infidels of the Quraysh.  The infidels of the Quraysh
			again wrote (a letter) to the Jews after the battle of Badr: You
			are men of weapons and fortresses. You should fight our companion
			or we shall deal with you in a certain way. And nothing will come
			between us and the anklets of your women. When their letter

			your companions, and thirty rabbis will come out from us till we
			meet at a central place where they will hear you. If they testify
			to you and believe in you, we shall believe in you. The narrator

			an army, and surrounded them.  He told them: I swear by Allah,
			you will have no peace from me until you conclude a treaty with
			me. But they refused to conclude a treaty with him. He therefore
			fought them the same day.  Next he attacked Banu Quraysh with an
			army in the morning, and left Banu an-Nadir. He asked them to
			sign a treaty and they signed it.  He turned away from them and
			attacked Banu an-Nadir with an army. He fought with them until

			took with them whatever their camels could carry, that is, their

		<p>
			I met Bilal, the Mu'adhdhin of the Apostle of Allah (peace be
			upon him) at Aleppo, and said: Bilal, tell me, what was the
			financial position of the Apostle of Allah (peace be upon him)? 
			He said: He had nothing. It was I who managed it on his behalf
			since the day Allah made him Prophet of Allah (peace be upon him)
			until he died. When a Muslim man came to him and he found him
			naked, he ordered me (to clothe him). I would go, borrow (some
			money), and purchase a cloak for him. I would then clothe him and
			feed him.  A man from the polytheists met me and said: I am well
			off, Bilal. Do not borrow money from anyone except me. So I did
			accordingly. One day when I performed ablution and stood up to
			make call to prayer, the same polytheist came along with a body
			of merchants.  When he saw me, he said: O Abyssinian.  I said: I
			am at your service. He met me with unpleasant looks and said
			harsh words to me.  He asked me: Do you know how many days remain
			in the completion of this month?  I replied: The time is near. 
			He said: Only four days remain in the completion of this month. I
			shall then take that which is due from you (i.e. loan), and then
			shall return you to tend the sheep as you did before. I began to
			think in my mind what people think in their minds (on such
			occasions). When I offered the night prayer, the Apostle of Allah
			(peace be upon him) returned to his family. I sought permission
			from him and he gave me permission.  I said: Apostle of Allah,
			may my parents be sacrificed for you, the polytheist from whom I
			used to borrow money said to me such-and-such. Neither you nor I
			have anything to pay him for me, and he will disgrace me. So give
			me permission to run away to some of those tribes who have
			recently embraced Islam until Allah gives His Apostle (peace be
			upon him) something with which he can pay (the debt) for me. So I
			came out and reached my house. I placed my sword, waterskin (or
			sheath), shoes and shield near my head. When dawn broke, I
			intended to be on my way.  All of a sudden I saw a man running
			towards me and calling: Bilal, return to the Apostle of Allah
			(peace be upon him). So I went till I reached him. I found four
			mounts kneeling on the ground with loads on them. I sought
			permission.  The Apostle of Allah (peace be upon him) said to me:
			Be glad, Allah has made arrangements for the payment (of your
			debt). He then asked: Have you not seen the four mounts kneeling
			on the ground?	I replied: Yes.  He said: You may have these
			mounts and what they have on them. There are clothes and food on
			them, presented to me by the ruler of Fadak. Take them away and
			pay off your debt. I did so.  He then mentioned the rest of the
			tradition. I then went to the mosque and found that the Apostle
			of Allah (peace be upon him) was sitting there. I greeted him. 
			He asked: What benefit did you have from your property?  I
			replied: Allah Most High paid everything which was due from the
			Apostle of Allah (peace be upon him). Nothing remains now.  He
			asked: Did anything remain (from that property)?  I said: Yes. 
			He said: Look, if you can give me some comfort from it, for I
			shall not visit any member of my family until you give me some
			comfort from it. When the Apostle of Allah (peace be upon him)
			offered the night prayer, he called me and said: What is the
			position of that which you had with you (i.e. property)?  I said:
			I still have it, no one came to me. The Apostle of Allah (peace
			be upon him) passed the night in the mosque.  He then narrated
			the rest of the tradition. Next day when he offered the night
			prayer, he called me and asked: What is the position of that
			which you had (i.e. the rest of the property)?	I replied: Allah
			has given you comfort from it, Apostle of Allah.  He said: Allah
			is Most Great, and praised Allah, fearing lest he should die
			while it was with him. I then followed him until he came to his
			wives and greeted each one of them and finally he came to his
			place where he had to pass the night. This is all for which you

		<p>
			Yahya ibn Subayh said: Ammar client of al-Harith ibn Nawfal told
			me that he attended the funeral of Umm Kulthum, and her son. The
			body of the boy was placed near the imam. I objected to it. Among
			the people there were Ibn Abbas, AbuSa'id al-Khudri, AbuQatadah

	<hadith num="1411">
		<narration by="Anas ibn Malik"/>
		<p>
			Nafi' AbuGhalib said: I was in the Sikkat al-Mirbad. A bier
			passed and a large number of people were accompanying it.  They
			said: Bier of Abdullah ibn Umayr. So I followed it. Suddenly I
			saw a man, who had a thin garment on riding his small mule. He
			had a piece of cloth on his head to protect himself from the sun.
			 I asked: Who is this important man? People said: This is Anas
			ibn Malik. When the bier was placed, Anas stood and led the
			funeral prayer over him while I was just behind him, and there
			was no obstruction between me and him. He stood near his head,
			and uttered four takbirs (Allah is Most Great). He neither
			lengthened the prayer nor hurried it. He then went to sit down.
			They said: AbuHamzah, (here is the bier of) an Ansari woman. They
			brought her near him and there was a green cupola-shaped
			structure over her bier. He stood opposite her hips and led the
			funeral prayer over her as he had led it over the man. He then
			sat down.  Al-Ala' ibn Ziyad asked: AbuHamzah, did the Apostle of
			Allah (peace be upon him) say the funeral prayer over the dead as
			you have done, uttering four takbirs (Allah is Most Great) over
			her, and standing opposite the head of a man and the hips of a
			woman?	He replied: Yes.  He asked: AbuHamzah, did you fight with
			the Apostle of Allah?  He replied: Yes. I fought with him in the
			battle of Hunayn. The polytheists came out and invaded us so
			severely that we saw our horses behind our backs. Among the
			people (i.e. the unbelievers) there was a man who was attacking
			us, and striking and wounding us (with his sword). Allah then
			defeated them. They were then brought and began to take the oath
			of allegiance to him for Islam.  A man from among the companions
			of the Prophet (peace be upon him) said: I make a vow to myself
			that if Allah brings the man who was striking us (with his sword)
			that day, I shall behead him. The Apostle of Allah (peace be upon
			him) kept silent and the man was brought (as a captive).  When he
			saw the Apostle of Allah (peace be upon him), he said: Apostle of
			Allah, I have repented to Allah. The Apostle of Allah (peace be
			upon him) stopped (for a while) receiving his oath of allegiance,
			so that the other man might fulfil his vow. But the man began to
			wait for the order of the Apostle of Allah (peace be upon him)
			for his murder. He was afraid of the Apostle of Allah (peace be
			upon him) to kill him. When the Apostle of Allah (peace be upon
			him) saw that he did not do anything, he received his oath of
			allegiance.  The man said: Apostle of Allah, what about my vow? 
			He said: I stopped (receiving his oath of allegiance) today so
			that you might fulfil your vow.  He said: Apostle of Allah, why
			did you not give any signal to me?  The Prophet (peace be upon
			him) said: It is not worthy of a Prophet to give a signal. 
			AbuGhalib said: I asked (the people) about Anas standing opposite
			the hips of a woman. They told me that this practice was due to
			the fact that (in the days of the Prophet) there were no
			cupola-shaped structures over the biers of women. So the imam
			used to stand opposite the hips of a woman to hide her from the
			people.

	<hadith num="1688">
		<narration by="Abdullah Ibn Abbas"/>
		<p>
			When the verse: "O ye who believe! eat not up your property among
			yourselves in vanities, but let there be amongst you traffic and
			trade by mutual good will" was revealed, a man thought it a sin
			to eat in the house of another man after the revelation of this
			verse.	Then this (injunction) was revealed by the verse in Surat
			an-Nur: "No blame on you whether you eat in company or
			separately."  When a rich man (after revelation) invited a man
			from his people to eat food in his house, he would say: I
			consider it a sin to eat from it, and he said: a poor man is more
			entitled to it than I. The Arabic word tajannah means sin or
			fault. It was then declared lawful to eat something on which the
			name of Allah was mentioned, and it was made lawful to eat the
			flesh of an animal slaughtered by the people of the Book.

			his family. Once he passed us when we were with AbudDarda'. 
			AbudDarda' said to him: Tell us a word which benefits us and does
			not harm you.  He said: The Apostle of Allah (peace be upon him)
			sent out a contingent and it came back. One of the men came and
			sat in the place where the Apostle of Allah (peace be upon him)
			used to sit, and he said to a man beside him: Would that you saw
			us when we met the enemy and so-and-so attacked and cut through a
			lance.	He said: Take it from me and I am a boy of the tribe
			Ghifar. What do you think about his statement?	He replied: I
			think his reward was lost.  Another man heard it and said: I do
			not think that there is any harm in it.  They quarrelled until
			the Apostle of Allah (peace be upon him) heard it, and he said:
			Glory be to Allah! There is no harm if he is rewarded and

			raise his hand to him and say: Did you hear it from the Apostle
			of Allah (peace be upon him)?  He said: Yes. He continued to
			repeat it to him so often that I thought he was going to kneel
			down. He said: On another day he again passed us.  AbudDarda'

			us: One who spends on (the maintenance of) horses (for jihad) is
			like the one who spreads his hand to give alms (sadaqah) and does
			not withhold it. He then passed us on another day.  AbudDarda'
			said to him: (Tell us) a word which benefits us and does no harm
			to you.  He said: The Apostle of Allah (peace be upon him) said:
			Khuraym al-Asadi would be a fine man were it not for the length
			of his hair, which reaches the shoulders, and the way he lets his
			lower garment hang down. When Khuraym heard that, he hurriedly,
			took a knife, cut his hair in line with his ears and raised his

		<p>
			Yazid ibn Nu'aym ibn Huzzal, on his father's authority said:
			Ma'iz ibn Malik was an orphan under the protection of my father.
			He had illegal sexual intercourse with a slave-girl belonging to
			a clan. My father said to him: Go to the Apostle of Allah (peace
			be upon him) and inform him of what you have done, for he may
			perhaps ask Allah for your forgiveness. His purpose in that was
			simply a hope that it might be a way of escape for him.  So he
			went to him and said: Apostle of Allah! I have committed
			fornication, so inflict on me the punishment ordained by Allah.
			He (the Prophet) turned away from him, so he came back and said:
			Apostle of Allah! I have committed fornication, so inflict on me
			the punishment ordained by Allah. He (again) turned away from
			him, so he came back and said: Apostle of Allah! I have committed
			fornication, so inflict on me the punishment ordained by Allah. 
			When he uttered it four times, the Apostle of Allah (peace be
			upon him) said: You have said it four times. With whom did you
			commit it?  He replied: With so and so.  He asked: Did you lie
			down with her?	He replied: Yes.  He asked: Had your skin been in
			contact with hers?  He replied. Yes.  He asked: Did you have
			intercourse with her?  He said: Yes. So he (the Prophet) gave
			orders that he should be stoned to death. He was then taken out
			to the Harrah, and while he was being stoned he felt the effect
			of the stones and could not bear it and fled. But Abdullah ibn
			Unays encountered him when those who had been stoning him could
			not catch up with him. He threw the bone of a camel's foreleg at
			him, which hit him and killed him. They then went to the Prophet
			(peace be upon him) and reported it to him.  He said: Why did you
			not leave him alone. Perhaps he might have repented and been
			forgiven by Allah.

			Muhammad ibn Ishaq said: I mentioned the story of Ma'iz ibn Malik
			to Asim ibn Umar ibn Qatadah.  He said to me: Hasan ibn Muhammad
			ibn Ali ibn AbuTalib said to me: Some men of the tribe of Aslam
			whom I do not blame and whom you like have transmitted to me the
			saying of the Apostle of Allah (peace be upon him): Why did you
			not leave him alone? He said: But I did not understand this
			tradition. So I went to Jabir ibn Abdullah and said (to him):
			Some men of the tribe of Aslam narrate that the Apostle of Allah
			(peace be upon him) said when they mentioned to him the anxiety
			of Ma'iz when the stones hurt him: "Why did you not leave him
			alone?' But I do not know this tradition.  He said: My cousin, I
			know this tradition more than the people. I was one of those who
			had stoned the man.  When we came out with him, stoned him and he
			felt the effect of the stones, he cried: O people! return me to
			the Apostle of Allah (peace be upon him). My people killed me and
			deceived me; they told me that the Apostle of Allah (peace be
			upon him) would not kill me. We did not keep away from him till
			we killed him. When we returned to the Apostle of Allah (peace be
			upon him) we informed him of it.  He said: Why did you not leave
			him alone and bring him to me? and he said this so that the
			Apostle of Allah (peace be upon him) might ascertain it from him.
			But he did not say this to abandon the prescribed punishment. He
			said: I then understood the intent of the tradition.

			The people passed by the Apostle of Allah (peace be upon him)
			with a Jew who was blackened with charcoal and who was being
			flogged.  He called them and said: Is this the prescribed
			punishment for a fornicator?  They said: Yes.  He then called on
			a learned man among them and asked him: I adjure you by Allah Who
			revealed the Torah to Moses, do you find this prescribed
			punishment for a fornicator in your divine Book?  He said: By
			Allah, no. If you had not adjured me about this, I should not
			have informed you. We find stoning to be prescribed punishment
			for a fornicator in our Divine Book. But it (fornication) became
			frequent in our people of rank; so when we seized a person of
			rank, we left him alone, and when we seized a weak person, we
			inflicted the prescribed punishment on him. So we said: Come, let
			us agree on something which may be enforced equally on people of
			higher and lower rank. So we agreed to blacken the face of a
			criminal with charcoal, and flog him, and we abandoned stoning. 
			The Apostle of Allah (peace be upon him) then said: O Allah, I am
			the first to give life to Thy command which they have killed. So
			he commanded regarding him (the Jew) and he was stoned to death. 
			Allah Most High then sent down: "O Apostle, let not those who
			race one another into unbelief, make thee grieve..." up to "They
			say: If you are given this, take it, but if not, beware!...." up
			to "And if any do fail to judge by (the light of) what Allah hath
			revealed, they are (no better than) unbelievers," about Jews, up
			to "And if any do fail to judge by (the right of) what Allah hath
			revealed, they are no better than) wrong-doers" about Jews: and
			revealed the verses up to "And if any do fail to judge by (the

	<hadith num="2093">
		<narration by="AbuHurayrah"/>
		<p>
			(This is Ma'mar's version which is more accurate.) A man and a
			woman of the Jews committed fornication.  Some of them said to
			the others: Let us go to this Prophet, for he has been sent with
			an easy law. If he gives a judgment lighter than stoning, we
			shall accept it, and argue about it with Allah, saying: It is a
			judgment of one of your prophets. So they came to the Prophet
			(peace be upon him) who was sitting in the mosque among his
			companions.  They said: AbulQasim, what do you think about a man
			and a woman who committed fornication? He did not speak to them a
			word till he went to their school.  He stood at the gate and
			said: I adjure you by Allah Who revealed the Torah to Moses, what
			(punishment) do you find in the Torah for a person who commits
			fornication, if he is married?	They said: He shall be blackened
			with charcoal, taken round a donkey among the people, and
			flogged. A young man among them kept silent.  When the Prophet
			(peace be upon him) emphatically adjured him, he said: By Allah,
			since you have adjured us (we inform you that) we find stoning in
			the Torah (is the punishment for fornication).	The Prophet
			(peace be upon him) said: So when did you lessen the severity of
			Allah's command? He said:  A relative of one of our kings had
			committed fornication, but his stoning was suspended. Then a man
			of a family of common people committed fornication. He was to
			have been stoned, but his people intervened and said: Our man
			shall not be stoned until you bring your man and stone him. So
			they made a compromise on this punishment between them.  The
			Prophet (peace be upon him) said: So I decide in accordance with
			what the Torah says. He then commanded regarding them and they
			were stoned to death.  Az-Zuhri said: We have been informed that
			this verse was revealed about them: "It was We Who revealed the
			Law (to Moses): therein was guidance and light. By its standard
			have been judged the Jews, by the Prophet who bowed (as in Islam)
			to Allah's will.

			I can still picture myself looking at the Apostle of Allah (peace
			be upon him) who was among the camps of the Companions seeking
			the camp of Khalid ibn al-Walid, when a man who had drunk wine
			was brought before him. He asked the people: Beat him. Some
			struck him with sandals, some with sticks and some with fresh
			branches of the palm-tree (mitakhah). Ibn Wahb said: This
			(mitakhah) means green palm fronds. Then the apostle of Allah
			(peace be upon him) took some dust from the ground and threw it
			on his face.

			A man who had drunk wine was brought before the Prophet (peace be

			He then ordered his Companions and they beat him with their
			sandals and whatever they had in their hands. He then said to
			them: Leave him,  and they left him. The Apostle of Allah (peace
			be upon him) then died, and AbuBakr gave forty lashes for
			drinking wine, and then Umar in the beginning of his Caliphate
			inflicted forty stripes and at the end of his Caliphate he
			inflicted eighty stripes. Uthman (after him) inflicted both

			I saw the Apostle of Allah (peace be upon him) on the morning of
			the conquest of Mecca when I was a young boy. He was walking
			among the people, seeking the camp of Khalid ibn al-Walid. A man
			who had drunk wine was brought (before him) and he ordered them
			(to beat him). So they beat him with what they had in their
			hands. Some struck him with whips, some with sticks and some with
			sandals. The Apostle of Allah (peace be upon him) threw some dust
			on his face.  When a man who had drunk wine was brought before
			AbuBakr, he asked them (i.e. the people) about the number of
			beatings which they gave him. They numbered it forty. So AbuBakr
			gave him forty lashes.	When Umar came to power, Khalid ibn
			al-Walid wrote to him: The people have become addicted to
			drinking wine and they look down upon the prescribed punishment
			and its penalty.  He said: They are with you, ask them. The
			immigrants who embraced Islam in the beginning were with him. He
			asked them and they agreed on the fact that (a drunkard) should
			be given eighty lashes.  Ali said: When a man drinks wine, he
			tells lies. I, therefore, think that he should be prescribed
			punishment that is prescribed for telling lies..

			Qurayzah and Nadir (were two Jewish tribes). An-Nadir were nobler

			When Prophethood was bestowed upon the Prophet (peace be upon

			Give him to us, we shall kill him.  They replied: We have the
			Prophet (peace be upon him) between you and us. So they came to
			him.  Thereupon the following verse was revealed: "If thou judge,

			Ziyad ibn Sa'd ibn Dumayrah as-Sulami said on the authority of

			Musa's version) who were present in the battle of Hunayn with the
			Apostle of Allah (peace be upon him): After the advent of Islam,
			Muhallam ibn Jaththamah al-Laythi killed a man of Ashja'. That
			was the first blood-money decided by the Apostle of Allah (peace
			be upon him) (for payment). Uyaynah spoke about the killing of
			al-Ashja'i, for he belonged to Ghatafan, and al-Aqra' ibn Habis
			spoke on behalf of Muhallam, for he belonged to Khunduf. The
			voices rose high, and the dispute and noise grew.  So the Apostle
			of Allah (peace be upon him) said: Do you not accept blood-money,
			Uyaynah?  Uyaynah then said: No, I swear by Allah, until I cause
			his women to suffer the same fighting and grief as he caused my
			women to suffer. Again the voices rose high, and the dispute and
			noise grew.  The Apostle of Allah (peace be upon him) said: Do
			you not accept the blood-money Uyaynah? Uyaynah gave the same
			reply as before, and a man of Banu Layth called Mukaytil stood
			up. He had a weapon and a skin shield in his hand.  He said: I do
			not find in the beginning of Islam any illustration for what he
			has done except the one that "some sheep came on, and those in
			the front were shot; hence those in the rear ran away". (The
			other example is that) "make a law today and change it."  The
			Apostle of Allah (peace be upon him) said: Fifty (camels) here
			immediately and fifty when we return to Medina. This happened
			during some of his journeys. Muhallam was a tall man of dark
			complexion. He was with the people. They continued (to make
			effort for him) until he was released. He sat before the Apostle
			of Allah (peace be upon him), with his eyes flowing.  He said:
			Apostle of Allah! I have done (the act) of which you have been
			informed. I repent to Allah, the Exalted, so ask Allah's
			forgiveness for me. Apostle of Allah!  The Apostle of Allah
			(peace be upon him) then said: Did you kill him with your weapon
			at the beginning of Islam. O Allah! do not forgive Muhallam. He
			said these words loudly.  AbuSalamah added: He (Muhallam) then
			got up while he was wiping his tears with the end of his garment.
			 Ibn Ishaq said: His people alleged that the Apostle of Allah
			(peace be upon him) asked forgiveness for him after that.

		<p>
			The Apostle of Allah (peace be upon him) would fix the
			blood-money for accidental killing at the rate of four hundred
			dinars or their equivalent in silver for townsmen, and he would
			fix it according to the price of camels. So when they were dear,
			he increased the amount to be paid, and when cheap prices
			prevailed he reduced the amount to be paid. In the time of the
			Apostle of Allah (peace be upon him) they reached between four
			hundred and eight hundred dinars, their equivalent in silver
			being eight thousand dirhams.  He said: The Apostle of Allah
			(peace be upon him) gave judgment that those who possessed cattle
			should pay two hundred cows, and those who possessed sheep two
			thousand sheep.  He said: The Apostle of Allah (peace be upon
			him) said: The blood-money is to be treated as something to be
			inherited by the heirs of the one who has been killed, and the
			remainder should be divided among the agnates.	He said: The
			Apostle of Allah (peace be upon him) gave judgment that for
			cutting off a nose completely there was full blood-money, one
			hundred (camels) were to be paid. If the tip of the nose was cut
			off, half of the blood-money,i.e. fifty camels were to be paid,
			or their equivalent in gold or in silver, or a hundred cows, or
			one thousand sheep. For the hand, when it was cut of,f half of
			the blood-money was to be paid; for one foot of half, the
			blood-money was to be paid. For a wound in the head, a third of
			the blood-money was due, i.e. thirty-three camels and a third of
			the blood-money, or their equivalent in gold, silver, cows or
			sheep. For a head thrust which reaches the body, the same
			blood-money was to be paid. Ten camels were to be paid for every
			finger, and five camels for every tooth.  The Apostle of Allah
			(peace be upon him) gave judgment that the blood-money for a
			woman should be divided among her relatives on her father's side,
			who did not inherit anything from her except the residence of her
			heirs. If she was killed, her blood-money should be distributed
			among her heirs, and they would have the right of taking revenge
			on the murderer.  The Apostle of Allah (peace be upon him) said:
			There is nothing for the murderer; and if he (the victim) has no
			heir, his heir will be the one who is nearest to him among the
			people, but the murderer should not inherit anything.  Muhammad
			said: All this has been transmitted to me by Sulayman ibn Musa on
			the authority of Amr ibn Shu'ayb who, on his father's authority,
			said that his grandfather heard it from the Prophet (peace be

			I was sitting in al-Batha with a company among whom the Apostle

			And muzn?  They said: And muzn. He said: And anan?  They said:
			And anan.  AbuDawud said: I am not quite confident about the word
			anan.  He asked:  Do you know the distance between Heaven and
			Earth?	They replied: We do not know.  He then said: The distance

			The heaven which is above it is at a similar distance (going on

			a sea, the distance between whose surface and bottom is like that

			used to say: Do not impose austerities on yourselves so that

			austerities on themselves and Allah imposed austerities on them.
			Their survivors are to be found in cells and monasteries. (Then
