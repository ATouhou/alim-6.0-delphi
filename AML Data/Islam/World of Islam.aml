				Islam is a religion based upon the surrender to God who is One.
The very name of the religion, al-Islam in Arabic, means at once
				submission and peace, for it is in submitting to God's Will that
				human beings gain peace in their lives in this world and in the
				hereafter. The message of Islam concerns God, who in Arabic is
				called Allah, and it addresses itself to humanity's most profound
				nature. It concerns men and women as they were created by
				God--not as fallen beings. Islam therefore considers itself to be
				not an innovation but a reassertion of the universal truth of all
				revelation which is God's Oneness.

			<media type="video" src="icl37.asf" caption="Similar in values to Judeo-Christian" narration="John Esposito"/>
			<p>
				This truth was asserted by the prophets of old and especially by
				Abraham, the father of monotheism. Islam reveres all of these
				prophets including not only Abraham, who is the father of the
				Arabs as well as of the Jews, but also Moses and Christ. The
				Prophet and Messenger of God, Muhammad--may peace and blessings
				be upon him, his family and his companions, was the last of this
				long line of prophets and Islam is the last religion until the
				Day of Judgement. It is the final expression of the Abrahamic
				tradition. One should in fact properly speak of the
				Judeo-Christian-Islamic tradition, for Islam shares with the
				other Abrahamic religions their sacred history, the basic ethical
				teachings contained in the Ten Commandments and above all, belief
				in the One God. And it renews and repeats the true beliefs of
				Jews and Christians whose scriptures are mentioned as divinely
				revealed books in Islam's own sacred book, the Quran.

		<section heading="Quran">
			<media type="video" src="icl06.asf" caption="Quran" narration="Generic"/>
			<media type="video" src="icl07.asf" caption="First verse of the Quran that was revealed" narration="Abdullah Hakeem"/>
			<p>
				For Muslims, or followers of Islam, the Quran is the actual Word
				of God revealed through the archangel Gabriel to the Prophet of
				Islam during the twenty-three-year period of his prophetic
				mission. It was revealed in the Arabic language as a sonoral
				revelation which the Prophet repeated to his companions. Arabic
				became therefore the language of Islam even for non-Arab Muslims.
				Under the direction of the Prophet, the verses and chapters were
				organized in the order known to Muslims to this day. There is
				only one text of the Quran accepted by all schools of Islamic
				thought and there are no variants.
			</p>
			<p>
				The Quran is the central sacred reality of Islam. The sound of
				the Quran is the first and last sound that a Muslim hears in this
				life. As the direct Word of God and the embodiment of God's Will,
				the Quran is considered as the guide par excellence for the life
				of Muslims. It is the source of all Islamic doctrines and ethics.
				Both the intellectual aspects of Islam and Islamic Law have their
				source in the Quran. Perhaps there is no book revered by any
				human collectivity as much as the Quran is revered by Muslims.
				Essentially a religion of the book, Islam sees all authentic
				religions as being associated with a scripture. That is why
				Muslims call Christians and Jews the "people of the book".
			</p>
			<p>
				Throughout all its chapters and verses, the Quran emphasizes the
				significance of knowledge and encourages Muslims to learn and to
				acquire knowledge not only of God's laws and religious
				injunctions, but also of the world of nature. The Quran refers,
				in a language rich in its varied terminology, to the importance
				of seeing, contemplating, and reasoning about the world of
				creation and its diverse phenomena. It places the gaining of
				knowledge as the highest religious activity, one that is most
				pleasing in God's eyes. That is why wherever the message of the
				Quran was accepted and understood, the quest for knowledge
				flourished.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Prophet of Islam">
			<p>
				The Prophet of Islam is loved and revered by Muslims precisely
				because he was chosen by God to reveal His Word to mankind. The
				Prophet Muhammad is not considered to be divine but a human
				being. However, he is seen as the most perfect of human beings,
				shining like a jewel among stones. He was born in 570 A. D. in
				one of the most powerful tribes in the Arabia of that time, for
				it had guardianship over the Ka'bah in Makkah. An orphan brought
				up by his grandfather and later by his uncle, the young Muhammad
				displayed exceptional virtue as a trustworthy individual whom
				members of various tribes would invite to act as arbitrator in
				their disputes.
			</p>
			<section heading="Early Years">
				<p>
					At that time the Arabs followed a form of idolatry, each
					tribe keeping its own idols at the Ka'bah, the cubical
					structure built originally by Abraham to celebrate the
					glory of the One God. But the monotheistic message of
					Abraham had long become forgotten among the general
					population of the Arabian peninsula. The young Muhammad,
					however, was a believer in the One God all of his life
					and never participated in the idolatrous practices of his
					tribe.
				</p>
			</section>
			<section heading="Angel Gabriel">
				<p>
					When forty years old, during one of the retreats which he
					made habitually in a cave on top of a mountain outside
					Makkah, Muhammad first saw the archangel Gabriel who
					revealed God's Word to him, the Quran, and announced that
					Muhammad is the messenger of God. For the next thirteen
					years he preached the Word of God to the Makkans,
					inviting them to abandon idolatry and accept the religion
					of Oneness. A few accepted his call but most Makkans,
					especially those of his own tribe, opposed him violently,
					seeing in the new religion a grave danger to their
					economic as well as social domination based upon their
					control of the Ka'bah. But the Prophet continued to call
					the people to Islam and gradually a larger number of men
					and women began to accept the faith and submit themselves
					to its teachings. As a result, persecution of Muslims
					increased until the Prophet was forced to send some of
					his companions to Abyssinia where they were protected by
					the Christian king.
				</p>
			</section>
			<section heading="Early days of Islam">
				<p>
					The Makkan period was also one of intense spiritual
					experience for the Prophet and the noble companions who
					formed the nucleus of the new religious community which
					was soon to spread worldwide. It was during this period
					that God ordered the direction of prayers to be changed
					from Jerusalem to Makkah. To this day Jerusalem remains
					along with Makkah and Madinah one of the holiest cities
					of Islam.
				</p>
			</section>
			<section heading="Migration">
				<p>
					In 622 A. D. the Prophet was ordered by God to migrate to
					Yathrib, a city north of Makkah. He followed the Divine
					Command and left with his followers for that city which
					henceforth was known as "The City of the Prophet"
					(Madinat al-nabi) or simply Madinah. This event was so
					momentous that the Islamic calendar begins with this
					migration (hijrah).
				</p>
				<p>
					In Madinah, the Prophet established the first Islamic
					society which has served as the model for all later
					Islamic societies. Several battles took place against the
					invading Makkans which the Muslims won against great
					odds. Soon more tribes began to join Islam and within a
					few years most of Arabia had embraced the religion of
					Islam.
				</p>
			</section>
			<section heading="Victory at Makkah">
				<p>
					After many trials and eventually successive victories,
the Prophet returned triumphantly to Makkah where the
					people embraced Islam at last. He forgave all his former
					enemies and marched to the Ka'bah, where he ordered his
					companion and cousin 'Ali to join him in destroying all
					the idols. The Prophet reconstituted the rite of
					pilgrimage as founded by Abraham. The Prophet then
					returned to Madinah and made another pilgrimage to
					Makkah. It was upon returning from this last pilgrimage
					that he delivered his farewell address. Soon he fell ill
					and after three days died in 632 A. D. in Madinah where
					he was buried in the chamber of his house next to the
					first mosque of Islam.
				</p>
			</section>
		</section>
		<section heading="Sunnah (practices) of the Prophet">
			<p>
				The practices and traditions (Sunnah) of the Prophet which
				includes his sayings (Hadith) became the guide for Muslims in the
				understanding of the Quran and the practice of their religion.
				The Quran itself asserts that God has chosen in the Prophet an
				example for Muslims to follow. Besides this emulation of the
				Prophet in all aspects of life and thought, his sayings were
				assembled by various scholars. Finally they were codified in
				books of Hadith where the authentic were separated from the
				spurious. The Sunnah has always remained, after the Quran, the
				second source of everything Islamic.

			<p>
				According to a famous saying of the Prophet Islam consists of
				five pillars which are as follows: affirmation of the faith
				(shahadah), that is, witnessing that La ilaha illa'Llah (There is
				no divinity but Allah) and Muhammadun rasul Allah (Muhammad is
				the Messenger of Allah); the five daily prayers (al-salat) which
				Muslims perform facing Makkah; fasting (al-sawm) from dawn to
				sunset during the month of Ramadan; making the pilgrimage to
				Makkah (al-hajj) at least once in a lifetime if one's financial
				and physical conditions permit it; and paying a 2 1/2% tax
				(al-zakat) on one's capital which is used for the needs of the
				community. Muslims are also commanded to exhort others to perform
				good acts and to abstain from evil. Ethics lies at the heart of
				Islamic teachings and all men and women are expected to act
				ethically towards each other at all times. As the Prophet has
				said, "None of you is a believer until you love for your brother
				what you love for yourself."
			</p>
			<p>
				As for faith according to Islam (al-iman), it means having faith
				in God, His angels, His books, His messengers, the Day of
				Judgment and God's determination of human destiny. It is
				important to understand that the definition of al-iman refers to
				books and prophets in the plural thus pointing directly to the
				universality of revelation and respect for other religions
				emphasized so much in the Quran. There is also the important
				concept, al-ihsan or virtue, which means to worship God as if one
				sees Him, knowing that even if one does not see Him, He sees us.
				It means to remember God at all times and marks the highest level
				of being a Muslim.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Islamic Law (al-Shari'ah)">
			<p>
				Islam possesses a religious law called al-Shari'ah in Arabic
				which governs the life of Muslims and which Muslims consider to
				be the embodiment of the Will of God. The Shari'ah is contained
				in principle in the Quran as elaborated and complemented by the
				Sunnah. On the basis of these principles the schools of law which
				are followed by all Muslims to this day were developed early in
				Islamic history. This Law, while being rooted in the sources of
				the Islamic revelation, is a living body of law which caters to
				the needs of Islamic society .
			</p>
			<p>
				Islamic laws are essentially preventative and are not based on
				harsh punishment except as a last measure. The faith of the
				Muslim causes him to have respect for the rights of others and
				Islamic Law is such that it prevents transgression from taking
				place in most instances. That is why what people consider to be
				harsh punishments are so rarely in need of being applied.

			<p>
				From the oasis cities of Makkah and Madinah in the Arabian
				desert, the message of Islam went forth with electrifying speed.
				Within half a century of the Prophet's death, Islam had spread to
				three continents. Islam is not, as some imagine in the West, a
				religion of the sword nor did it spread primarily by means of
				war. It was only within Arabia, where a crude form of idolatry
				was rampant, that Islam was propagated by warring against those
				tribes which did not accept the message of God--whereas
				Christians and Jews were not forced to convert. Outside of Arabia
				also the vast lands conquered by the Arab armies in a short
				period became Muslim not by force of the sword but by the appeal
				of the new religion. It was faith in One God and emphasis upon
				His Mercy that brought vast numbers of people into the fold of
				Islam. The new religion did not coerce people to convert. Many
				continued to remain Jews and Christians and to this day important
				communities of the followers of these faiths are found in Muslim
				lands.
			</p>
			<p>
				Moreover, the spread of Islam was not limited to its miraculous
				early expansion outside of Arabia. During later centuries the
				Turks embraced Islam peacefully as did a large number of the
				people of the Indian subcontinent and the Malay-speaking world.
				In Africa also, Islam has spread during the past two centuries
				even under the mighty power of European colonial rulers. Today
				Islam continues to grow not only in Africa but also in Europe and
				America where Muslims now comprise a notable minority.

		</p>
		<section heading="General Characteristics of Islamic Civilization">
			<media type="video" src="icl04.asf" caption="Muslim population" narration="Abdullah Hakeem"/>
			<p>
				Islam was destined to become a world religion and to create a
				civilization which stretched from one end of the globe to the
				other. Already during the early Muslim caliphates, first the
				Arabs, then the Persians and later the Turks set about to create
				classical Islamic civilization. Later, in the 13th century, both
				Africa and India became great centers of Islamic civilization and
				soon thereafter Muslim kingdoms were established in the
				Malay-Indonesian world while Chinese Muslims flourished
				throughout China.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Global religion">
			<media type="video" src="icl26.asf" caption="Islam is a world religion" narration="Generic"/>
			<media type="video" src="icl27.asf" caption="Islam is the universal religion" narration="Abdullah Hakeem"/>
			<p>
				Islam is a religion for all people from whatever race or
				background they might be. That is why Islamic civilization is
				based on a unity which stands completely against any racial or
				ethnic discrimination. Such major racial and ethnic groups as the
				Arabs, Persians, Turks, Africans, Indians, Chinese and Malays in
				addition to numerous smaller units embraced Islam and contributed
				to the building of Islamic civilization. Moreover, Islam was not
				opposed to learning from the earlier civilizations and
				incorporating their science, learning, and culture into its own
				world view, as long as they did not oppose the principles of
				Islam. Each ethnic and racial group which embraced Islam made its
				contribution to the one Islamic civilization to which everyone
				belonged. The sense of brotherhood and sisterhood was so much
				emphasized that it overcame all local attachments to a particular
				tribe, race, or language--all of which became subservient to the
				universal brotherhood and sisterhood of Islam.
			</p>
			<p>
				The global civilization thus created by Islam permitted people of
				diverse ethnic backgrounds to work together in cultivating
				various arts and sciences. Although the civilization was
				profoundly Islamic, even non-Muslim "people of the book"
				participated in the intellectual activity whose fruits belonged
				to everyone. The scientific climate was reminiscent of the
				present situation in America where scientists and men and women
				of learning from all over the world are active in the advancement
				of knowledge which belongs to everyone.
			</p>
			<p>
				The global civilization created by Islam also succeeded in
				activating the mind and thought of the people who entered its
				fold. As a result of Islam, the nomadic Arabs became
				torch-bearers of science and learning. The Persians who had
				created a great civilization before the rise of Islam
				nevertheless produced much more science and learning in the
				Islamic period than before. The same can be said of the Turks and
				other peoples who embraced Islam. The religion of Islam was
				itself responsible not only for the creation of a world
				civilization in which people of many different ethnic backgrounds
				participated, but it played a central role in developing
				intellectual and cultural life on a scale not seen before. For
				some eight hundred years Arabic remained the major intellectual
				and scientific language of the world. During the centuries
				following the rise of Islam, Muslim dynasties ruling in various
				parts of the Islamic world bore witness to the flowering of
				Islamic culture and thought. In fact this tradition of
				intellectual activity was eclipsed only at the beginning of
				modern times as a result of the weakening of faith among Muslims
				combined with external domination. And today this activity has
				begun anew in many parts of the Islamic world now that the
				Muslims have regained their political independence.

		<section heading="A Brief History of Islam: The Rightly Guided Caliphs">
			<p>
				Upon the death of the Prophet, Abu Bakr, the friend of the
				Prophet and the first adult male to embrace Islam, became caliph.
				Abu Bakr ruled for two years to be succeeded by 'Umar who was
				caliph for a decade and during whose rule Islam spread
				extensively east and west conquering the Persian empire, Syria
				and Egypt. It was 'Umar who marched on foot at the end of the
				Muslim army into Jerusalem and ordered the protection of
				Christian sites. 'Umar also established the first public treasury
				and a sophisticated financial administration. He established many
				of the basic practices of Islamic government.
			</p>
			<p>
				'Umar was succeeded by 'Uthman who ruled for some twelve years
				during which time the Islamic expansion continued. He is also
				known as the caliph who had the definitive text of the Noble
				Quran copied and sent to the four corners of the Islamic world.
				He was in turn succeeded by 'Ali who is known to this day for his
				eloquent sermons and letters, and also for his bravery. With his
				death the rule of the "rightly guided" caliphs, who hold a
				special place of respect in the hearts of Muslims, came to an
				end.

		<section heading="The Caliphates">
			<section heading="Umayyad">
				<p>
					The Umayyad caliphate established in 661 was to last for
					about a century. During this time Damascus became the
					capital of an Islamic world which stretched from the
					western borders of China to southern France. Not only did
					the Islamic conquests continue during this period through
					North Africa to Spain and France in the West and to Sind,
					Central Asia and Transoxiana in the East, but the basic
					social and legal institutions of the newly founded
					Islamic world were established.
				</p>
			</section>
			<section heading="Abbasids">
				<p>
					The Abbasids, who succeeded the Umayyads, shifted the
					capital to Baghdad which soon developed into an
					incomparable center of learning and culture as well as
					the administrative and political heart of a vast world.
				</p>
				<p>
					They ruled for over 500 years but gradually their power
					waned and they remained only symbolic rulers bestowing
					legitimacy upon various sultans and princes who wielded
					actual military power. The Abbasid caliphate was finally
					abolished when Hulagu, the Mongol ruler, captured Baghdad
					in 1258, destroying much of the city including its
					incomparable libraries.
				</p>
				<p>
					While the Abbasids ruled in Baghdad, a number of powerful
					dynasties such as the Fatimids, Ayyubids and Mamluks held
					power in Egypt, Syria and Palestine. The most important
					event in this area as far as the relation between Islam
					and the Western world was concerned was the series of
					Crusades declared by the Pope and espoused by various
					European kings. The purpose, although political, was
					outwardly to recapture the Holy Land and especially
					Jerusalem for Christianity. Although there was at the
					beginning some success and local European rule was set up
					in parts of Syria and Palestine, Muslims finally
					prevailed and in 1187 Saladin, the great Muslim leader,
					recaptured Jerusalem and defeated the Crusaders.

		<section heading="North Africa and Spain">
			<p>
				When the Abbasids captured Damascus, one of the Umayyad princes

				Umayyad rule there, thus beginning the golden age of Islam in
				Spain. Cordoba was established as the capital and soon became
				Europe's greatest city not only in population but from the point
				of view of its cultural and intellectual life. The Umayyads ruled
				over two centuries until they weakened and were replaced by local
				rulers.
			</p>
			<p>
				Meanwhile in North Africa, various local dynasties held sway
				until two powerful Berber dynasties succeeded in uniting much of
				North Africa and also Spain in the 12th and 13th centuries. After
				them this area was ruled once again by local dynasties such as
				the Sharifids of Morocco who still rule in that country. As for
				Spain itself, Muslim power continued to wane until the last
				Muslim dynasty was defeated in Granada in 1492 thus bringing
				nearly eight hundred years of Muslim rule in Spain to an end.

		<section heading="Islamic History after the Mongol Invasion">

				The Mongols devastated the eastern lands of Islam and ruled from

				to Islam and became known as the Il-Khanids. They were in turn
				succeeded by Timur and his descendents who made Samarqand their
				capital and ruled from 1369 to 1500. The sudden rise of Timur
				delayed the formation and expansion of the Ottoman empire but
				soon the Ottomans became the dominant power in the Islamic world.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Ottoman Empire">
			<p>
				From humble origins the Turks rose to dominate over the whole of
				Anatolia and even parts of Europe. In 1453 Mehmet the Conqueror
				captured Constantinople and put an end to the Byzantine empire.
The Ottomans conquered much of eastern Europe and nearly the whole
				of the Arab world, only Morocco and Mauritania in the West and
				Yemen, Hadramaut and parts of the Arabian peninsula remaining
				beyond their control. They reached their zenith of power with
				Suleyman the Magnificent whose armies reached Hungary and
				Austria. From the 17th century onward with the rise of Western
				European powers and later Russia, the power of the Ottomans began
				to wane. But they nevertheless remained a force to be reckoned
				with until the First World War when they were defeated by the
Western nations. Soon thereafter Kamal Ataturk gained power in
				Turkey and abolished the six centuries of rule of the Ottomans in
				1924.

		<section heading="Persia">
			<p>
While the Ottomans were concerned mostly with the western front of
				their empire, to the east in Persia a new dynasty called the
				Safavids came to power in 1502. The Safavids established a
				powerful state of their own which flourished for over two
				centuries and became known for the flowering of the arts. Their
				capital, Isfahan, became one of the most beautiful cities with
				its blue tiled mosques and exquisite houses. The Afghan invasion
				of 1736 put an end to Safavid rule and prepared the independence
				of Afghanistan which occurred formally in the 19th century. Persia
itself fell into turmoil until Nader Shah, the last Oriental
				conqueror, reunited the country and even conquered India. But the
				rule of the dynasty established by him was short-lived. The Zand
				dynasty soon took over to be overthrown by the Qajars in 1779 who

				As for India, Islam entered into the land east of the Indus River
				peacefully. Gradually Muslims gained political power beginning in
				the early 13th century. But this period which marked the

				the conquest of much of India in 1526 by Babur, one of the
				Timurid princes. He established the powerful Mogul empire which
				produced such famous rulers as Akbar, Jahangir, and Shah Jahan

			<p>
As far as Africa is concerned, Islam entered into East Africa at
				the very beginning of the Islamic period but remained confined to
				the coast for some time, only the Sudan and Somaliland becoming
				gradually both Arabized and Islamized. West Africa felt the
				presence of Islam through North African traders who traveled
				with their camel caravans south of the Sahara. By the 14th
				century there were already Muslim sultanates in such areas as
				Mali, and Timbuctu in West Africa and Harar in East Africa had
become seats of Islamic learning.
			</p>
			<p>
				Gradually Islam penetrated both inland and southward. There also
				appeared major charismatic figures who inspired intense
				resistance against European domination. The process of the
				Islamization of Africa did not cease during the colonial period
				and continues even today with the result that most Africans are
				now Muslims carrying on a tradition which has had practically as
				long a history in certain areas of sub-Saharan Africa as Islam

				Islam is a religion based upon knowledge for it is ultimately
				knowledge of the Oneness of God combined with faith and total
				commitment to Him that saves man. The text of the Quran is
				replete with verses inviting man to use his intellect, to ponder,
				to think and to know, for the goal of human life is to discover
				the Truth which is none other than worshipping God in His
				Oneness. The Hadith literature is also full of references to the
				importance of knowledge. Such sayings of the Prophet as "Seek
				knowledge even in China", "Seek knowledge from the cradle to the
				grave", and "Verily the men of knowledge are the inheritors of
				the prophets", have echoed throughout the history of Islam and
				incited Muslims to seek knowledge wherever it might be found.
				During most of its history, Islamic civilization has been witness
				to a veritable celebration of knowledge. That is why every
				traditional Islamic city possessed public and private libraries
				and some cities like Cordoba and Baghdad boasted of libraries
				with over 400,000 books. Such cities also had bookstores, some of
				which sold a large number of titles. That is also why the scholar
				has always been held in the highest esteem in Islamic society.

		<section heading="Integration of the Pre-Islamic Sciences">
			<p>
				As Islam spread northward into Syria, Egypt, and the Persian
				empire, it came face to face with the sciences of antiquity whose
				heritage had been preserved in centers which now became a part of
				the Islamic world. Alexandria had been a major center of sciences
				and learning for centuries. The Greek learning cultivated in
				Alexandria was opposed by the Byzantines who had burned its
				library long before the advent of Islam. The tradition of
				Alexandrian learning did not die, however. It was transferred to
				Antioch and from there farther east to such cities as Edessa by
				eastern Christians who stood in sharp opposition to Byzantium and
				wished to have their own independent centers of learning.
				Moreover, the Persian king, Shapur I, had established Jundishapur
				in Persia as a second great center of learning matching Antioch.
				He even invited Indian physicians and mathematicians to teach in
				this major seat of learning, in addition to the Christian
				scholars who taught in Syriac as well as the Persians whose
				medium of instruction was Pahlavi.
			</p>
			<p>
				Once Muslims established the new Islamic order during the Umayyad
				period, they turned their attention to these centers of learning
				which had been preserved and sought to acquaint themselves with
				the knowledge taught and cultivated in them. They therefore set
				about with a concerted effort to translate the philosophical and
				scientific works which were available to them from not only Greek
				and Syriac (which was the language of eastern Christian scholars)
				but also from Pahlavi, the scholarly language of pre-Islamic
				Persia, and even from Sanskrit. Many of the accomplished
				translators were Christian Arabs such as Hunayn ibn Ishaq, who
				was also an outstanding physician, and others Persians such as
				Ibn Muqaffa', who played a major role in the creation of the new
				Arabic prose style conducive to the expression of philosophical
				and scientific writings. The great movement of translation lasted
				from the beginning of the 8th to the end of the 9th century,
				reaching its peak with the establishment of the House of Wisdom
				(Bayt alhikmah) by the caliph al-Ma'mun at the beginning of the
				9th century.
			</p>
			<p>
				The result of this extensive effort of the Islamic community to
				confront the challenge of the presence of the various
				philosophies and sciences of antiquity and to understand and
				digest them in its own terms and according to its own world view
				was the translation of a vast corpus of writings into Arabic.
				Most of the important philosophical and scientific works of
				Aristotle and his school, much of Plato and the Pythagorean
				school, and the major works of Greek astronomy, mathematics and
				medicine such as the Almagest of Ptolemy, the Elements of Euclid,
				and the works of Hippocrates and Galen, were all rendered into
				Arabic. Furthermore, important works of astronomy, mathematics
				and medicine were translated from Pahlavi and Sanskrit. As a
				result, Arabic became the most important scientific language of
				the world for many centuries and the depository of much of the
				wisdom and the sciences of antiquity.
			</p>
			<p>
				The Muslims did not translate the scientific and philosophical
				works of other civilizations out of fear of political or economic
				domination but because the structure of Islam itself is based
				upon the primacy of knowledge. Nor did they consider these forms
				of knowing as "un-lslamic" as long as they confirmed the doctrine
				of God's Oneness which Islam considers to have been at the heart
				of every authentic revelation from God. Once these sciences and
				philosophies confirmed the principle of Oneness, the Muslims
				considered them as their own. They made them part of their world
				view and began to cultivate the Islamic sciences based on what
				they had translated, analyzed, criticized, and assimilated,
				rejecting what was not in conformity with the Islamic perspective
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Mathematical Sciences and Physics">
			<p>
				The Muslim mind has always been attracted to the mathematical
				sciences in accordance with the "abstract" character of the
				doctrine of Oneness which lies at the heart of Islam. The
				mathematical sciences have traditionally included astronomy,
				mathematics itself and much of what is called physics today.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Astronomy">
			<p>
				In astronomy the Muslims integrated the astronomical traditions
				of the Indians, Persians, the ancient Near East and especially
				the Greeks into a synthesis which began to chart a new chapter in
				the history of astronomy from the 8th century onward. The
				Almagest of Ptolemy, whose very name in English reveals the
				Arabic origin of its Latin translation, was thoroughly studied
				and its planetary theory criticized by several astronomers of
				both the eastern and western lands of Islam leading to the major
				critique of the theory by Nasir al-Din al-Tusi and his students,
				especially Qutb alDin al-Shirazi, in the 13th century.
			</p>
			<p>
				The Muslims also observed the heavens carefully and discovered
				many new stars. The book on stars of 'Abd al-Rahman al-Sufi was
				in fact translated into Spanish by Alfonso X el Sabio and had a
				deep influence upon stellar toponymy in European languages. Many
				star names in English such as Aldabaran still recall their Arabic
				origin. The Muslims carried out many fresh observations which
				were contained in astronomical tables called zij. One of the
				acutest of these observers was al-Battani whose work was followed
				by numerous others. The zij of al-Ma'mun observed in Baghdad, the
				Hakimite zij of Cairo, the Toledan Tables of alZarqali and his
				associates, the ll-Khanid zij of Nasir al-Din al-Tusi observed in
				Maraghah, and the zij of Ulugh-Beg from Samarqand are among the
				most famous Islamic astronomical tables. They wielded a great
				deal of influence upon Western astronomy up to the time of Tycho
				Brahe. The Muslims were in fact the first to create an
				astronomical observatory as a scientific institution, this being
				the observatory of Maraghah in Persia established by al-Tusi.
				This was indirectly the model for the later European
				observatories . Many astronomical instruments were developed by
				Muslims to carry out observation, the most famous being the
				astrolabe. There existed even mechanical astrolabes perfected by
				Ibn Samh which must be considered as the ancestor of the
				mechanical clock.
			</p>
			<p>
				Astronomical observations also had practical applications
				including not only finding the direction of Makkah for prayers,
				but also devising almanacs (the word itself being of Arabic
				origin). The Muslims also applied their astronomical knowledge to
				questions of time-keeping and the calendar. The most exact solar
				calendar existing to this day is the Jalali calendar devised
				under the direction of 'Umar Khayyam in the 12th century and
				still in use in Persia and Afghanistan.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Mathematics, Algebra">
			<p>
				As for mathematics proper, like astronomy, it received its direct
				impetus from the Quran not only because of the mathematical
				structure related to the text of the Sacred Book, but also
				because the laws of inheritance delineated in the Quran require
				rather complicated mathematical solutions. Here again Muslims
				began by integrating Greek and Indian mathematics. The first
				great Muslim mathematician, al-Khwarazmi, who lived in the 9th
				century, wrote a treatise on arithmetic whose Latin translation
				brought what is known as Arabic numerals to the West. To this day
				guarismo, derived from his name, means figure or digit in Spanish
				while algorithm is still used in English. Al-Khwarazmi is also
				the author of the first book on algebra. This science was
				developed by Muslims on the basis of earlier Greek and Indian
				works of a rudimentary nature. The very name algebra comes from
				the first part of the name of the book of al-Khwarazmi, entitled
				Kirah al-jahr wa'l-muqabalah. Abu Kamil al-Shuja' discussed
				algebraic equations with five unknowns. The science was further
				developed by such figures as al-Karaji until it reached its peak
				with Khayyam who classified by kind and class algebraic equations
				up to the third degree.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Geometry">
			<p>
				The Muslims also excelled in geometry as reflected in their art.
				The brothers Banu Musa who lived in the 9th century may be said
				to be the first outstanding Muslim geometers while their
				contemporary Thabit ibn Qurrah used the method of exhaustion,
				giving a glimpse of what was to become integral calculus. Many
				Muslim mathematicians such as Khayyam and al-Tusi also dealt with
				the fifth postulate of Euclid and the problems which follow if
				one tries to prove this postulate within the confines of
				Euclidean geometry.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Trigonometry">
			<p>
				Another branch of mathematics developed by Muslims is
				trigonometry which was established as a distinct branch of
				mathematics by al-Biruni. The Muslim mathematicians, especially
				al-Battani, Abu'l-Wafa', Ibn Yunus and Ibn al-Haytham, also
				developed spherical astronomy and applied it to the solution of
				astronomical problems.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Number Theory">
			<p>
				The love for the study of magic squares and amicable numbers led
				Muslims to develop the theory of numbers. Al-Khujandi discovered
				a particular case of Fermat's theorem that "the sum of two cubes
				cannot be another cube", while alKaraji analyzed arithmetic and
				geometric progressions such as: 1^3+2^3+3^3+...+n^3=(
				1+2+3+...+n)^2.
			</p>
			<p>
				Al-Biruni also dealt with progressions while Ghiyath al-Din
				Jamshid al-Kashani brought the study of number theory among
				Muslims to its peak.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Physics, Balance, Projectile Motion, Optics">
			<p>
				In the field of physics the Muslims made contributions in
				especially three domains. The first was the measurement of
				specific weights of objects and the study of the balance
				following upon the work of Archimedes. In this domain the
				writings of al-Biruni and al-Khazini stand out. Secondly they
				criticized the Aristotelian theory of projectile motion and tried
				to quantify this type of motion. The critique of Ibn Sina,
				Abu'l-Barakat al-Baghdadi, Ibn Bajjah and others led to the
				development of the idea of impetus and momentum and played an
				important role in the criticism of Aristotelian physics in the
				West up to the early writings of Galileo. Thirdly there is the
				field of optics in which the Islamic sciences produced in Ibn
				al-Haytham (the Latin Alhazen) who lived in the 11th century, the
				greatest student of optics between Ptolemy and Witelo. Ibn
				al-Haytham's main work on optics, the Kitah al-manazir, was also
				well known in the West as Thesaurus opticus. Ibn al-Haytham
				solved many optical problems, one of which is named after him,
				studied the property of lenses, discovered the camera obscura,
				explained correctly the process of vision, studied the structure
				of the eye, and explained for the first time why the sun and the
				moon appear larger on the horizon. His interest in optics was
				carried out two centuries later by Qutb al-Din al-Shirazi and
				Kamal al-Din al-Farisi. It was Qutb al-Din who gave the first
				correct explanation of the formation of the rainbow.

		<section heading="Experimental Method">
			<media type="video" src="icl08.asf" caption="Scientific pursuit" narration="Hamza Yusuf"/>
			<p>
				It is important to recall that in physics as in many other fields
				of science the Muslims observed, measured and carried out
				experiments. They must be credited with having developed what
				came to be known later as the experimental method.

				The hadiths of the Prophet contain many instructions concerning
				health including dietary habits; these sayings became the
				foundation of what came to be known later as "Prophetic medicine"
				(al-tibb al-nabawi). Because of the great attention paid in Islam
				to the need to take care of the body and to hygiene, early in
				Islamic history Muslims began to cultivate the field of medicine
				turning once again to all the knowledge that was available to
				them from Greek, Persian and Indian sources. At first the great
				physicians among Muslims were mostly Christian but by the 9th
				century Islamic medicine, properly speaking, was born with the
				appearance of the major compendium, 
			</p>
			<section heading="Rhazes Anatomy Smallpox Antiseptic Psychosomatic Medicine">
				<p>
					The Paradise of Wisdom (Firdaws al-hikmah ) by 'Ali ibn
					Rabban al-Tabari, who synthesized the Hippocratic and
					Galenic traditions of medicine with those of India and
					Persia. His student, Muhammad ibn Zakariyya' al-Razi (the
					Latin Rhazes), was one of the greatest of physicians who
					emphasized clinical medicine and observation. He was a
					master of prognosis and psychosomatic medicine and also
					of anatomy. He was the first to identify and treat
					smallpox, to use alcohol as an antiseptic and make
					medical use of mercury as a purgative. His Kitab al-hawi
					(Continens) is the longest work ever written in Islamic
					medicine and he was recognized as a medical authority in
					the West up to the 18th century.
				</p>
			</section>
			<section heading="The Canon of Medicine and Meningitis">
				<p>
					The greatest of all Muslim physicians, however, was Ibn
					Sina who was called "the prince of physicians" in the
					West. He synthesized Islamic medicine in his major
					masterpiece, al-Qanun fi'l tibb (The Canon of Medicine),
					which is the most famous of all medical books in history.
					It was the final authority in medical matters in Europe
					for nearly six centuries and is still taught wherever
					Islamic medicine has survived to this day in such lands
					as Pakistan and India. Ibn Sina discovered many drugs and
					identified and treated several ailments such as
					meningitis but his greatest contribution was in the
					philosophy of medicine. He created a system of medicine
					within which medical practice could be carried out and in
					which physical and psychological factors, drugs and diet
					are combined.
				</p>
			</section>
			<section heading="Pulmonary Circulation">
				<p>
					After Ibn Sina, Islamic medicine divided into several
					branches. In the Arab world Egypt remained a major center
					for the study of medicine, especially ophthalmology which
					reached its peak at the court of al-Hakim. Cairo
					possessed excellent hospitals which also drew physicians
					from other lands including Ibn Butlan, author of the
					famous Calendar of Health, and Ibn Nafis who discovered
					the lesser or pulmonary circulation of the blood long
					before Michael Servetus, who is usually credited with the
					discovery.
				</p>
			</section>
			<section heading="Gynecology">
			<media type="video" src="icl07.asf" caption="First verse of the Quran that was revealed" narration="Abdullah Hakeem"/>
			<media type="video" src="icl07.asf" caption="Zygote clinging in uterus" narration="Abdullah Hakeem"/>
				<p>
					As for the western lands of Islam including Spain, this
					area was likewise witness to the appearance of
					outstanding physicians such as Sa'd al-Katib of Cordoba
					who composed a treatise on gynecology, and the greatest
					Muslim figure in surgery, the 12th century Abu'l-Qasim
					al-Zahrawi (the Latin Albucasis) whose medical
					masterpiece Kitab al-tasrif was well known in the West as
					Concessio. One must also mention the Ibn Zuhr family
					which produced several outstanding physicians and Abu
					Marwan 'Abd al-Malik who was the Maghrib's most
					outstanding clinical physician. The well known Spanish
					philosophers, Ibn Tufayl and Ibn Rushd, were also
					outstanding physicians.
				</p>
				<p>
					Islamic medicine continued in Persia and the other
					eastern lands of the Islamic world under the influence of
					Ibn Sina with the appearance of major Persian medical
					compendia such as the Treasury of Sharaf al-Din
					al-Jurjani and the commentaries upon the Canon by Fakhr
					al-Din al-Razi and Qutb al-Din al-Shirazi. Even after the
					Mongol invasion, medical studies continued as can be seen
					in the work of Rashid al-Din Fadlallah, and for the first
					time there appeared translations of Chinese medicine and
					interest in acupuncture among Muslims. The Islamic
					medical tradition was revived in the Safavid period when
					several diseases such as whooping cough were diagnosed
					and treated for the first time and much attention was
					paid to pharmacology. Many Persian doctors such as 'Ayn
					al-Mulk of Shiraz also travelled to India at this time to
					usher in the golden age of Islamic medicine in the
					subcontinent and to plant the seed of the Islamic medical
					tradition which continues to flourish to this day in the
					soil of that land.
				</p>
			</section>
			<section heading="Major Hospitals">
				<p>
					The Ottoman world was also an arena of great medical
					activity derived from the heritage of Ibn Sina. The
					Ottoman Turks were especially known for the creation of
					major hospitals and medical centers. These included not
					only units for the care of the physically ill, but also
					wards for patients with psychological ailments. The
					Ottomans were also the first to receive the influence of
					modem European medicine in both medicine and
					pharmacology.
				</p>
				<p>
					In mentioning Islamic hospitals it is necessary to
					mention that all major Islamic cities had hospitals; some
					like those of Baghdad were teaching hospitals while some
					like the Nasiri hospital of Cairo had thousands of beds
					for patients with almost any type of illness. Hygiene in
					these hospitals was greatly emphasized and al-Razi had
					even written a treatise on hygiene in hospitals. Some
					hospitals also specialized in particular diseases
					including psychological ones. Cairo even had a hospital
					which specialized in patients having insomnia.
				</p>
			</section>
		</section>
		<section heading="Pharmacology">
			<p>
Islamic medical authorities were also always concerned with the
				significance of pharmacology and many important works such as the
				Canon have whole books devoted to the subject. The Muslims became
				heir not only to the pharmacological knowledge of the Greeks as
				contained in the works of Dioscorides, but also the vast herbal
pharmacopoeias of the Persians and Indians. They also studied the
				medical effects of many drugs, especially herbs, themselves. The
				greatest contributions in this field came from Maghribi
				scientists such as Ibn Juljul, Ibn al-Salt and the most original
of Muslim pharmacologist, the 12th century scientist,
				al-Ghafiqi, whose Book of Simple Drugs provides the best
				descriptions of the medical properties of plants known to
				Muslims. Islamic medicine combined the use of drugs for medical
				purposes with dietary considerations and a whole lifestyle
				derived from the teachings of Islam to create a synthesis which
				has not died out to this day despite the introduction of modem
				medicine into most of the Islamic world.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Natural History and Geography">
			<p>
				The vast expanse of the Islamic world enabled the Muslims to
				develop natural history based not only on the Mediterranean
				world, as was the case of the Greek natural historians, but also
				on most of the Eurasian and even African land masses. Knowledge
				of minerals, plants and animals was assembled from areas as far
				away as the Malay world and synthesized for the first time by Ibn
				Sina in his Kitab al-Shifa' (The Book of Healing). Such major
				natural historians as al-Mas'udi intertwined natural and human
				history. Al-Biruni likewise in his study of India turned to the
				natural history and even geology of the region, describing
				correctly the sedimentary nature of the Ganges basin. He also
				wrote the most outstanding Muslim work on mineralogy.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Botany, Zoology">
			<p>
				As for botany, the most important treatises were composed in the
				12th century in Spain with the appearance of the work of
				al-Ghafiqi. This is also the period when the best known Arabic
				work on agriculture, the Kitab al-falahah, was written. The
				Muslims also showed much interest in zoology especially in horses
				as witnessed by the classical text of al-Jawaliqi, and in falcons
				and other hunting birds. The works of al-Jahiz and al-Damiri are
				especially famous in the field of zoology and deal with the
				literary, moral and even theological dimensions of the study of
				animals as well as the purely zoological aspects of the subject.
				This is also true of a whole class of writings on the "wonders of
				creation" of which the book of Abu Yahya al-Qazwini, the 'Aja'ih
				al-makhluqat (The Wonders of Creation) is perhaps the most
				famous.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Geography">
			<p>
				Likewise in geography, Muslims were able to extend their horizons
				far beyond the world of Ptolemy. As a result of travel over land
				and by sea and the facile exchange of ideas made possible by the
				unified structure of the Islamic world and the hajj which enables
				pilgrims from all over the Islamic world to gather and exchange
				ideas in addition to visiting the House of God, a vast amount of
				knowledge of areas from the Pacific to the Atlantic was
				assembled. The Muslim geographers starting with al-Khwarazmi, who
				laid the foundation of this science among Muslims in the 9th
				century, began to study the geography of practically the whole
				globe minus the Americas, dividing the earth into the traditional
				seven climes each of which they studied carefully from both a
				geographical and climactic point of view. They also began to draw
				maps some of which reveal with remarkable accuracy many features
				such as the origin of the Nile, not discovered in the West until
				much later. The foremost among Muslim geographers was Abu
				'Abdallah al-Idrisi, who worked at the court of Roger II in
				Sicily and who dedicated his famous book, Kitab al-rujari (The
				Book of Roger) to him. His maps are among the great achievements
				of Islamic science. It was in fact with the help of Muslim
				geographers and navigators that Magellan crossed the Cape of Good
				Hope into the Indian Ocean. Even Columbus made use of their
				knowledge in his discovery of America.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Chemistry">
			<p>
				The very name alchemy as well as its derivative chemistry come
				from the Arabic al-kimiya'. The Muslims mastered Alexandrian and
				even certain elements of Chinese alchemy and very early in their
				history, produced their greatest alchemist, Jabir ibn Hayyan (the
				Latin Geber) who lived in the 8th century. Putting the
				cosmological and symbolic aspects of alchemy aside, one can
				assert that this art led to much experimentation with various
				materials and in the hands of Muhammad ibn Zakariyya' al-Razi was
				converted into the science of chemistry. To this day certain
				chemical instruments such as the alembic (al-'anbiq) still bear
				their original Arabic names and the mercury-sulphur theory of
				Islamic alchemy remains as the foundation of the acid-base theory
				of chemistry. Al-Razi's division of materials into animal,
				vegetable and mineral is still prevalent and a vast body of
				knowledge of materials accumulated by Islamic alchemists and
				chemists has survived over the centuries in both East and West.
				For example the use of dyes in objects of Islamic art ranging
				from carpets to miniatures or the making of glass have much to do
				with this branch of learning which the West learned completely
				from Islamic sources since alchemy was not studied and practiced
				in the West before the translation of Arabic texts into Latin in
				the 11th century .

		<section heading="Technology">
			<media type="video" src="icl14.asf" caption="Muslim contribution in North America" narration="Generic"/>
			<p>
Islam inherited the millennial experience in various forms of
				technology from the peoples who entered the fold of Islam and the
				nations which became part of Dar al-Islam. A wide range of
				technological knowledge, from the building of water wheels by the
				Romans to the underground water system by the Persians, became
				part and parcel of the technology of the newly founded order.
				Muslims also imported certain kinds of technology from the Far
				East such as paper which they brought from China and whose
				technology they later transmitted to the West. They also
				developed many forms of technology on the basis of earlier
				existing knowledge such as the metallurgical art of making the
				famous Damascene swords, an art which goes back to the making of
				steel several thousand years before on the Iranian plateau.
				Likewise Muslims developed new architectural techniques of
				vaulting, methods of ventilation, preparations of dyes,
				techniques of weaving, technologies related to irrigation and
				numerous other forms of technology, some of which survive to this
				day.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Man and Nature">
			<p>
				In general Islamic civilization emphasized the harmony between
				man and nature as seen in the traditional design of Islamic
				cities. Maximum use was made of natural elements and forces, and
				men built in harmony with, not in opposition to nature. Some of
				the Muslim technological feats such as dams which have survived
				for over a millenium, domes which can withstand earthquakes, and
				steel which reveals incredible metallurgical know-how, attest to
				the exceptional attainment of Muslims in many fields of
				technology. In fact it was a vastly superior technology that
				first impressed the Crusaders in their unsuccessful attempt to
				capture the Holy Land and much of this technology was brought
				back by the Crusaders to the rest of Europe.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Architecture">
			<media type="video" src="icl14.asf" caption="Muslim contribution in North America" narration="Generic"/>
			<p>
				One of the major achievements of Islamic civilization is
				architecture which combines technology Treatises on natural and
				art. The great masterpieces of Islamic architecture from the
				Cordoba Mosque and the Dome of	the Rock in Jerusalem to the Taj
				Mahal in India, scientists were often display this perfect
				wedding between the artistic illustrated with detailed principles
				of Islam and remarkable technological know-how. Much of the
				outstanding medieval facilitate teaching of the architecture of
				the West is in fact indebted to the techniques of Islamic
				architecture. When one views the Notre Dame in Paris or some
				other Gothic cathedral, one is reminded of the building
				techniques which travelled from Muslim Cordoba northward. Gothic
				arches as well as interior courtyards of so many medieval and
				Renaissance European structures remind the viewer of the Islamic
				architectural examples from which they originally drew. In fact
				the great medieval European architectural tradition is one of the
				elements of Western civilization most directly linked with the
Islamic world, while the presence of Islamic architecture can
				also be directly experienced in the Moorish style found not only
				in Spain and Latin America, but in the southwestern United States
				as well.

				The oldest university in the world which is still functioning is
				the eleven hundred-year-old Islamic university of Fez, Morocco,
				known as the Qarawiyyin. This old tradition of Islamic learning
				influenced the West greatly through Spain. In this land where
				Muslims, Christians and Jews lived for the most part peacefully
				for many centuries, translations began to be made in the 11th
				century mostly in Toledo of Islamic works into Latin often
				through the intermediary of Jewish scholars most of whom knew
				Arabic and often wrote in Arabic. As a result of these
				translations, Islamic thought and through it much of Greek
				thought became known to the West and Western schools of learning
				began to flourish. Even the Islamic educational system was
				emulated in Europe and to this day the term chair in a university
				reflects the Arabic kursi (literally seat) upon which a teacher
				would sit to teach his students in the madrasah (school of higher
				learning). As European civilization grew and reached the high
				Middle Ages, there was hardly a field of learning or form of art,
				whether it was literature or architecture, where there was not

				At the height of European colonial expansion in the 19th century,
				most of the Islamic world was under colonial rule with the
				exception of a few regions such as the heart of the Ottoman
				empire, Persia, Afghanistan, Yemen and certain parts of Arabia.
				But even these areas were under foreign influence or, in the case
				of the Ottomans, under constant threat. After the First World War
				with the breakup of the Ottoman empire, a number of Arab states
				such as Iraq became independent, others like Jordan were created
				as a new entity and yet others like Palestine, Syria and Lebanon
				were either mandated or turned into French colonies. As for
				Arabia, it was at this time that Saudi Arabia became finally
				consolidated. As for other parts of the Islamic world, Egypt
				which had been ruled by the descendents of Muhammad Ali since the
				l9th century became more independent as a result of the fall of
				the Ottomans, Turkey was turned into a secular republic by
				Ataturk, and the Pahlavi dynasty began a new chapter in Persia
				where its name reverted to its eastern traditional form of Iran.
				But most of the rest of the Islamic world remained under colonial
				rule.

					It was only after the Second World War and the

					sheikdoms around the Gulf and the Arabian Sea by the
					1960's. The North African countries of Tunisia, Morocco
					and Algeria had to fight a difficult and, in the case of
					Algeria, long and protracted war to gain their freedom
					which did not come until a decade later for Tunisia and

			<p>
				Muslims did not wish to gain only their political independence.
				They also wished to assert their own religious and cultural
				identity. From the 18th century onward Muslim reformers appeared
				upon the scene who sought to reassert the teachings of Islam and
				to reform society on the basis of Islamic teachings. One of the
				first among this group was Muhammad ibn 'Abd al-Wahhab, who
				hailed from the Arabian peninsula and died there in 1792. This
				reformer was supported by Muhammad ibn al-Sa'ud, the founder of
				the first Saudi state. With this support Muhammad ibn 'Abd
				al-Wahhab was able to spread his teachings not only in Arabia but
				even beyond its borders to other Islamic lands where his reforms
				continue to wield influence to this day.
			</p>
			<p>
				In the 19th century Islamic assertion took several different
				forms ranging from the Mahdi movement of the Sudan and the
				Sanusiyyah in North Africa which fought wars against European
				colonizers, to educational movements such as that of Aligarh in
				India aiming to reeducate Muslims. In Egypt which, because of
				al-Azhar University, remains to this day central to Islamic
				learning, a number of reformers appear, each addressing some
				aspect of Islamic thought. Some were concerned more with law,
				others economics, and yet others the challenges posed by Western
				civilization with its powerful science and technology. These
				included Jamal al-Din al-Afghani who hailed originally from
				Persia but settled in Cairo and who was the great champion of
				Pan-Islamism, that is the movement to unite the Islamic world
				politically as well as religiously. His student, Muhammad 'Abduh,
				who became the rector of al-Azhar. was also very influential in
				Islamic theology and thought. Also of considerable influence was
				his Syrian student, Rashid Rida, who held a position closer to
				that of 'Abd al-Wahhab and stood for the strict application of
				the Shari'ah. Among the most famous of these thinkers is Muhammad
				Iqbal, the outstanding poet and philosopher who is considered as
				the father of Pakistan.
			</p>
			<section heading="Reform Organizations">
				<p>
					Moreover, as Western influence began to penetrate more
					deeply into the fiber of Islamic society, organizations
					gradually grew up whose goal was to reform society in
					practice along Islamic lines and prevent its
					secularization. These included the Muslim Brotherhood
					(Ikhwan al-muslimin) founded in Egypt and with branches
					in many Muslim countries, and the Jama'at-i Islami of
					Pakistan founded by the influential Mawlana Mawdudi.
					These organizations have been usually peaceful and have
					sought to reestablish an Islamic order through education.
					During the last two decades, however, as a result of the
					frustration of many Muslims in the face of pressures
					coming from a secularized outside world, some have sought
					to reject the negative aspects of Western thought and
					culture and to return to an Islamic society based
					completely on the application of the Shari 'ah. Today in
					every Muslim country there are strong movements to
					preserve and propagate Islamic teachings. In countries
					such as Saudi Arabia Islamic Law is already being applied
					and in fact is the reason for the prosperity, development
					and stability of the country. In other countries where
					Islamic Law is not being applied, however, most of the
					effort of Islamic movements is spent in making possible
					the full application of the Shari'ah so that the nation
					can enjoy prosperity along with the fulfillment of the
					faith of its people. In any case the widespread desire
					for Muslims to have the religious law of Islam applied
					and to reassert their religious values and their own
					identity must not be equated with exceptional violent
					eruptions which do exist but which are usually treated
					sensationally and taken out of proportion by the mass
					media in the West.

				In seeking to live successfully in the modern world, in
				independence and according to Islamic principles, Muslim
				countries have been emphasizing a great deal the significance of
				the role of education and the importance of mastering Western
				science and technology. Already in the 19th century, certain
				Muslim countries such as Egypt, Ottoman Turkey and Persia
				established institutions of higher learning where the modem
				sciences and especially medicine were taught. During this century
				educational institutions at all levels have proliferated
				throughout the Islamic world. Nearly every science ranging from
				mathematics to biology as well as various fields of modern
				technology are taught in these institutions and some notable
				scientists have been produced by the Islamic world, men and women
				who have often combined education in these institutions with
				training in the West.
			</p>
			<p>
				In various parts of the Islamic world there is, however, a sense
				that educational institutions must be expanded and also have
				their standards improved to the level of the best institutions in
the world in various fields of learning especially science and
				technology. At the same time there is an awareness that the
				educational system must be based totally on Islamic principles
				and the influence of alien cultural and ethical values and norms,
				to the extent that they are negative, be diminished. To remedy
				this problem a number of international Islamic educational
				conferences have been held, the first one in Makkah in 1977, and
				the foremost thinkers of the Islamic world have been brought
				together to study and ponder over the question of the relation
				between Islam and modern science. This is an ongoing process
				which is at the center of attention in many parts of the Islamic
				world and which indicates the significance of educational
				questions in the Islamic world today.

				Islam is not a new religion, but the same truth that God revealed
				through all His prophets to every people. For a fifth of the
				world's population, Islam is both a religion and a complete way
				of life. Muslims follow a religion of peace, mercy, and
				forgiveness, and the majority have nothing to do with the

				Muslims believe in One, Unique, Incomparable God; in the Angels
				created by Him; in the prophets through whom His revelations were
				brought to mankind; in the Day of Judgement and individual
				accountability for actions; in God's complete authority over
				human destiny and in life after death. Muslims believe in a chain
				of prophets starting with Adam and including Noah, Abraham,
				Ishmael, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph, Job, Moses, Aaron, David, Solomon,
				Elias, Jonah, John the Baptist, and Jesus, peace be upon them.
				But God's final message to man, a reconfirmation of the eternal
				message and a summing-up of all that has gone before was revealed
				to the Prophet Muhammad (SAW) through Gabriel. 
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="How does someone become a Muslim?">
			<p>
				Simply by saying 'There is no god apart from God, and Muhammad is
				the Messenger of God.' By this declaration the believer announces
				his or her faith in all God's messengers, and the scriptures they
				brought.

			<p>
				The Arabic word 'Islam' simply means 'submission', and derives
				from a word meaning 'peace'. In a religious context it means
				complete submission to the will of God. 'Mohammedanism' is thus a
				misnomer because it suggests that Muslims worship Muhammad (SAW)
				rather than God. 'Allah' is the Arabic name for God, which is
				used by Arab Muslims and Christians alike.

			<media type="video" src="icl39.asf" caption="Negative stereotype of Islam" narration="Abdullah Hakeem"/>
			<p>
				Islam may seem exotic or even extreme in the modern world.
				Perhaps this is because religion does not dominate everyday life
				in the West today, whereas Muslims have religion always uppermost
				in their minds, and make no division between secular and sacred.
				They believe that the Divine Law, the Shari'a, should be taken
				very seriously, which is why issues related to religion are still
				so important.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Do Islam and Christianity have different origins?">
			<media type="video" src="icl19.asf" caption="Adam and Eve" narration="Abdullah Hakeem"/>
			<p>
				No. Together with Judaism, they go back to the prophet and
				patriarch Abraham, and their three prophets are directly
				descended from his sons--Muhammad (SAW) from the eldest, Ishmael,
				and Moses and Jesus, peace be upon them, from Isaac. Abraham
				established the settlement which today is the city of Makkah, and
				built the Ka'ba towards which all Muslims turn when they pray.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="What is the Ka'ba?">
			<p>
				The Ka'ba is the place of worship which God commanded Abraham and
				Ishmael to build over four thousand years ago. The building was
				constructed of stone on what many believe was the original site
				of a sanctuary established by Adam. God commanded Abraham to
				summon all mankind to visit this place, and when pilgrims go
				there today they say 'At Thy service, O Lord', in response to
				Abraham's summons.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Who is Muhammad?">
			<p>
				Muhammad (SAW) was born in Makkah in the year 570, at a time when
				Christianity was not yet fully established in Europe. Since his
				father died before his birth, and his mother shortly afterwards,
				he was raised by his uncle from the respected tribe of Quraysh.
				As he grew up, he became known for his truthfulness, generosity
				and sincerity, so that he was sought after for his ability to
				arbitrate in disputes. The historians describe him as calm and
				meditative.
			</p>
			<p>
				Muhammad (SAW) was of a deeply religious nature, and had long
				detested the decadence of his society. It became his habit to
				meditate from time to time in the Cave of Hira near the summit of
				Jabal al-Nur, the 'Mountain of Light' near Makkah.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="How did he become a prophet and a messenger of God?">
			<p>
				At the age of 40, while engaged in a meditative retreat, Muhammad
				received his first revelation from God through the Angel Gabriel.
				This revelation, which continued for twenty-three years, is known
				as the Quran.
			</p>
			<p>
				As soon as he began to recite the words he heard from Gabriel,
				and to preach the truth which God had revealed to him, he and his
				small group of followers suffered bitter persecution, which grew
				so fierce that in the year 622 God gave them the command to
				emigrate. This event, the Hijra, 'migration', in which they left
				Makkah for the city of Madinah some 260 miles to the north, marks
				the beginning of the Muslim calendar.
			</p>
			<p>
				After several years, the Prophet (SAW) and his followers were
				able to return to Makkah, where they forgave their enemies and
				established Islam definitively. Before the Prophet (SAW) died at
				the age of 63, the greater part of Arabia was Muslim, and within
				a century of his death Islam had spread to Spain in the West and
				as far East as China.

			<media type="video" src="icl12.asf" caption="Muslim contribution to science and western culture" narration="John Esposito"/>
			<p>
				Among the reasons for the rapid and peaceful spread of Islam was
				the simplicity of its doctrine. Islam calls for faith in only One
				God worthy of worship. It also repeatedly instructs man to use
				his powers of intelligence and observation.
			</p>
			<p>
				Within a few years, great civilizations and universities were
				flourishing, for according to the Prophet (SAW) 'seeking
				knowledge is an obligation for every Muslim man and woman'. The
				synthesis of Eastern and Western ideas and of new thought with
				old, brought about great advances in medicine, mathematics,
				physics, astronomy, geography, architecture, art, literature, and
				history. Many crucial systems such as algebra, the Arabic
				numerals, and also the concept of the zero (vital to the
				advancement of mathematics), were transmitted to medieval Europe
				from Islam. Sophisticated instruments which were to make possible
				the European voyages of discovery were developed, including the
				astrolabe, the quadrant and good navigational maps.
			</p>

				The Prophet (SAW) said, 'Seek knowledge even into China': the Hui
				Shen mosque was built in the seventh century.

			<p>
				The Quran is a record of the exact words revealed by God through
				the Angel Gabriel to the Prophet Muhammad (SAW). It was memorized
				by Muhammad (SAW) and then dictated to his Companions, and
				written down by scribes, who cross-checked it during his
				lifetime. Not one word of its 114 chapters, Suras, has been
				changed over the centuries, so that the Quran is in every detail
				the unique and miraculous text which was revealed to Muhammad
				(SAW) fourteen centuries ago.

			<media type="video" src="icl07.asf" caption="First verse of the Quran that was revealed" narration="Abdullah Hakeem"/>
			<p>
				The Quran, the last revealed Word of God, is the prime source of
				every Muslim's faith and practice. It deals with all the subjects
				which concern us as human beings: wisdom, doctrine, worship, and
				law, but its basic theme is the relationship between God and His
				creatures. At the same time it provides guidelines for a just
				society, proper human conduct and an equitable economic system.
			</p>
		</section>
		<section heading="Are there any other sacred sources?">
			<p>
				Yes, the sunna, the practice and example of the Prophet (SAW), is
				the second authority for Muslims. A hadith is a reliably
				transmitted report of what the Prophet (SAW) said, did, or
				approved. Belief in the sunna is part of the Islamic faith.
			</p>
			<section heading="Examples of the Prophet's sayings">
				<p>
					The Prophet (SAW) said:
				</p>
				<p>
					'God has no mercy on one who has no mercy for others.'
				</p>
				<p>
					'None of you truly believes until he wishes for his
					brother what he wishes for himself.'
				</p>
				<p>
					'He who eats his fill while his neighbor goes without
					food is not a believer.'
				</p>
				<p>
					'The truthful and trusty businessman is associated with
					the prophets the saints, and the martyrs.'
				</p>
				<p>
					'Powerful is not he who knocks the other down, indeed
					powerful is he who controls himself in a fit of anger.'
				</p>
				<p>
					'God does not judge according to your bodies and
					appearances but He scans your hearts and looks into your
					deeds.'
				</p>
				<p>
					'A man walking along a path felt very thirsty. Reaching a
					well he descended into it, drank his fill and came up.
					Then he saw a dog with its tongue hanging out, trying to
					lick up mud to quench its thirst. The man saw that the
					dog was feeling the same thirst as he had felt so he went
					down into the well again and filled his shoe with water
					and gave the dog a drink. God forgave his sins for this
					action.' The Prophet (SAW) was asked: 'Messenger of God,
					are we rewarded for kindness towards animals?' He said,
					'There is a reward for kindness to every living thing.'

		<section heading="What are the 'Five Pillars' of Islam?">
			<media type="video" src="icl30.asf" caption="Five pillars of Islam build moral character" narration="Generic"/>
			<p>
				They are the framework of the Muslim life: faith, prayer, concern
				for the needy, self-purification, and the pilgrimage to Makkah
				for those who are able.
			</p>
			<section heading="First Pillar: Faith">
				<p>
					There is no god worthy of worship except God and Muhammad
					is His messenger. This declaration of faith is called the
					Shahada, a simple formula which all the faithful
					pronounce. In Arabic, the first part is la ilaha
					illa'Llah - 'there is no god except God'; ilaha (god) can
					refer to anything which we may be tempted to put in place
					of God--wealth, power, and the like. Then comes
					illa'Llah: 'except God', the source of all Creation. The
					second part of the Shahada is Muhammadun rasulu'Llah:
					'Muhammad is the messenger of God.' A message of guidance
					has come through a man like ourselves.
				</p>
			</section>
			<section heading="Second Pillar: Prayer">
			<media type="video" src="icl31.asf" caption="Importance and power of prayer" narration="Hakeem Olajuwon, Hamza Yusuf"/>
				<p>
					Salat is the name for the obligatory prayers which are
					performed five times a day, and are a direct link between
					the worshipper and God. There is no hierarchical
					authority in Islam, and no priests, so the prayers are
					led by a learned person who knows the Quran, chosen by
					the congregation. These five prayers contain verses from
					the Quran, and are said in Arabic, the language of the
					Revelation, but personal supplication can be offered in
					one's own language.
				</p>
				<p>
					Prayers are said at dawn, noon, mid-afternoon, sunset and
					nightfall, and thus determine the rhythm of the entire
					day. Although it is preferable to worship together in a
					mosque, a Muslim may pray almost anywhere, such as in
					fields, offices, factories and universities. Visitors to
					the Muslim world are struck by the centrality of prayers
					in daily life.
				</p>
				<p>
					A translation of the Call to Prayer is:
				</p>
				<p>
					'God is most great. God is most great. God is most great.
					God is most great. I testify that there is no god except
					God. I testify that there is no god except God. I testify
					that Muhammad is the messenger of God. I testify that
					Muhammad is the messenger of God. Come to prayer! Come to
					prayer! Come to success (in this life and the Hereafter)!
					Come to success! God is most great. God is most great.
					There is no god except God.'
				</p>
				<p>
					Once Muslims prayed towards Jerusalem, but during the
					Prophet's lifetime it was changed to Makkah. From the
					minbar, the pulpit, the Imam who leads the prayer gives
					the sermon at the Friday noon community prayers.
				</p>
			</section>
			<section heading="Third Pillar: Zakat ">
			<media type="video" src="icl32.asf" caption="Zakat, ideal welfare system" narration="Hamza Yusuf, John Esposito"/>
				<p>
					One of the most important principles of Islam is that all
					things belong to God, and that wealth is therefore held
					by human beings in trust. The word zakat means both
					'purification' and 'growth'. Our possessions are purified
					by setting aside a proportion for those in need, and,
					like the pruning of plants, this cutting back balances
					and encourages new growth.
				</p>
				<p>
					Each Muslim calculates his or her own zakat individually.
					For most purposes this involves the payment each year of
					two and a half percent of one's capital.
				</p>
				<p>
					A pious person may also give as much as he or she pleases
					as sadaqa, and does so preferably in secret. Although
					this word can be translated as 'voluntary charity' it has
					a wider meaning. The Prophet (SAW) said: 'Even meeting
					your brother with a cheerful face is charity.'
				</p>
				<p>
The Prophet (SAW) said: 'Charity is a necessity for every
					Muslim.' He was asked: 'What if a person has nothing?'
The Prophet (SAW) replied: 'He should work with his own
					hands for his benefit and then give something out of such
					earnings in charity.' The Companions asked: 'What if he
					is not able to work?' The Prophet (SAW) said: 'He should

					asked 'What if he cannot do even that?' The Prophet (SAW)
					said 'He should urge others to do good.' The Companions
					said 'What if he lacks that also?' The Prophet (SAW) said
					'He should check himself from doing evil. That is also
					charity.'

			<media type="video" src="icl33.asf" caption="Fasting in Ramadan" narration="Hamza Yusuf"/>
				<p>
					Every year in the month of Ramadan, all Muslims fast from
					first light until sundown, abstaining from food, drink,
					and sexual relations. Those who are sick, elderly, or on
a journey, and women who are pregnant or nursing are
					permitted to break the fast and make up an equal number
					of days later in the year. If they are physically unable
					to do this, they must feed a needy person for every day
					missed. Children begin to fast (and to observe the
					prayer) from puberty, although many start earlier.
				</p>
				<p>
					Although the fast is most beneficial to the health, it is
regarded principally as a method of self-purification. By
					cutting oneself off from worldly comforts, even for a
					short time, a fasting person gains true sympathy with
					those who go hungry as well as growth in one's spiritual
					life.

			<section heading="Fifth Pillar: The Pilgrimage (Hajj)">
			<media type="video" src="icl34.asf" caption="Pilgrimage to Makkah (Hajj)" narration="Hakeem Olajuwon, John Esposito"/>
				<p>
					The annual pilgrimage to Makkah, the Hajj, is an
					obligation only for those who are physically and
					financially able to perform it. Nevertheless, about two
					million people go to Makkah each year from every comer of
					the globe providing a unique opportunity for those of
					different nations to meet one another. Although Makkah is
					always filled with visitors, the annual Hajj begins in
					the twelfth month of the Islamic year (which is lunar,
					not solar, so that Hajj and Ramadan fall sometimes in
					summer, sometimes in winter). Pilgrims wear special
					clothes: simple garments which strip away distinctions of
					class and culture, so that all stand equal before God.
				</p>
				<p>
					The rites of the Hajj, which are of Abrahamic origin,
					include circling the Ka'ba seven times, and going seven
					times between the mountains of Safa and Marwa as did
					Hagar during her search for water. Then the pilgrims
					stand together on the wide plain of Arafa and join in
					prayers for God's forgiveness, in what is often thought
					of as a preview of the Last Judgement.
				</p>
				<p>
In previous centuries the Hajj was an arduous undertaking.
					Today, however, Saudi Arabia provides millions of people
					with water, modem transport, and the most up-to-date
					health facilities.
				</p>
				<p>
					The close of the Hajj is marked by a festival, the Eid
					al-Adha, which is celebrated with prayers and the
					exchange of gifts in Muslim communities everywhere. This,
					and the Eid al-Fitr, a feast-day commemorating the end of
					Ramadan, are the main festivals of the Muslim calendar.

				The Quran says: God forbids you not, with regards to those who
				fight you not for [your] faith nor drive you out of your homes,
				from dealing kindly and justly with them; for God loveth those
				who are just. (Quran, 60.8)
			</p>
			<p>
				It is one function of Islamic law to protect the privileged
				status of minorities, and this is why non-Muslim places of
				worship have flourished all over the Islamic world. History
				provides many examples of Muslim tolerance towards other faiths:
				when the caliph Omar entered Jerusalem in the year 634, Islam
				granted freedom of worship to all religious communities in the
				city.
			</p>
			<p>
				Islamic law also permits non-Muslim minorities to set up their own
				courts, which implement family laws drawn up by the minorities
				themselves.
			</p>
			<p>
				When the caliph Omar took Jerusalem from the Byzantines, he
				insisted on entering the city with only a small number of his
				companions. Proclaiming to the inhabitants that their lives and
				property were safe, and that their places of worship would never
				be taken from them, he asked the Christian patriarch Sophronius
				to accompany him on a visit to all the holy places.
			</p>
			<p>
				The Patriarch invited him to pray in the Church of the Holy
				Sepulchre, but he preferred to pray outside its gates, saying
				that if he accepted, later generations of Muslims might use his
				action as an excuse to turn it into a mosque. Above is the mosque
				built on the spot where Omar did pray.
			</p>
			<p>
According to Islam, man is not born in 'original sin'. He is God's
				vicegerent on earth. Every child is born with the fitra, an
				innate disposition towards virtue, knowledge, and beauty. Islam
				considers itself to be the 'primordial religion', din al-hanif,
				it seeks to return man to his original, true nature in which he
				is in harmony with creation, inspired to do good, and confirming
				the Oneness of God.

			<media type="video" src="icl37.asf" caption="Similar in values to Judeo-Christian" narration="John Esposito"/>
			<p>
				Muslims respect and revere Jesus (SAW) and await his Second
				Coming. They consider him one of the greatest of God's messengers
				to mankind. A Muslim never refers to him simply as 'Jesus', but
				always adds the phrase 'upon him be peace'. The Quran confirms
				his virgin birth (a chapter of the Quran is entitled 'Mary'), and
				Mary is considered the purest woman in all creation. The Quran
				describes the Annunciation as follows:
			</p>
			<p>
				'Behold!' the Angel said, 'God has chosen you, and purified you,
				and chosen you above the women of all nations. O Mary, God gives
				you good news of a word from Him, whose name shall be the
				Messiah, Jesus son of Mary, honored in this world and the
				Hereafter, and one of those brought near to God. He shall speak
				to the people from his cradle and in maturity, and shall be of
				the righteous.'
			</p>
			<p>
				She said: 'O my Lord! How shall I have a son when no man has
				touched me?' He said: 'Even so; God creates what He will. When He
				decrees a thing He says to it, "Be!" and it is.' (Quran, 3.42-7)
			</p>
			<p>
				Jesus (SAW) was born miraculously through the same power which
				had brought Adam (SAW) into being without a father:
			</p>
			<p>
				Truly, the likeness of Jesus with God is as the likeness of Adam.
				He created him of dust, and then said to him, 'Be!' and he was.
				(3.59)
			</p>
			<p>
				During his prophetic mission Jesus (SAW) performed many miracles.
				The Quran tells us that he said:
			</p>
			<p>
				'I have come to you with a sign from your Lord: I make for you
				out of clay, as it were, the figure of a bird, and breathe into
				it and it becomes a bird by God's leave. And I heal the blind,
				and the lepers, and I raise the dead by God's leave.' (3.49)
			</p>
			<p>
Neither Muhammad (SAW) nor Jesus (SAW) came to change the basic
				doctrine of the belief in One God, brought by earlier prophets,
				but to confirm and renew it. In the Quran Jesus (SAW) is reported
				as saying that he came:
			</p>
			<p>
				'To attest the law which was before me. And to make lawful to you
that of what was forbidden you; I have come to you with a sign
				from your Lord, so fear God and obey Me.' (3:5O)
			</p>
			<p>
				The Prophet Muhammad (SAW) said:
			</p>
			<p>
				'Whoever believes there is no god but God, alone without partner,
				that Muhammad (SAW) is His messenger, that Jesus is the servant
				and messenger of God, His word breathed into Mary and a spirit
				emanating from Him, and that Paradise and Hell are true, shall be
				received by God into Heaven.' (Hadith from Bukhari)

			<p>
				Islam sees a woman, whether single or married, as an individual
				in her own right, with the right to own and dispose of her
				property and earnings. A marriage dowry is given by the groom to
				the bride for her own personal use, and she keeps her own family
				name rather than taking her husband's.
			</p>
			<p>
				Both men and women are expected to dress in a way which is modest
				and dignified; the traditions of female dress found in some
				Muslim countries are often the expression of local customs.
			</p>
			<p>
				The Messenger of God said:
			</p>
			<p>
				'The most perfect in faith amongst believers is he who is best in
				manner and kindest to his wife.'

				The religion of Islam was revealed for all societies and all

			<p>
				A Muslim marriage is not a 'sacrament', but a simple, legal
				agreement in which either partner is free to include conditions.
				Marriage customs thus vary widely from country to country. As a
				result, divorce is not common, although it is not forbidden as a
				last resort. According to Islam, no Muslim girl can be forced to
				marry against her will: her parents will simply suggest young men
				they think may be suitable.

			<p>
				In the Islamic world there are no old people's homes. The strain
				of caring for one's parents in this most difficult time of their
				lives is considered an honor and blessing, and an opportunity for
				great spiritual growth. God asks that we not only pray for our
				parents, but act with limitless compassion, remembering that when
				we were helpless children they preferred us to themselves.
				Mothers are particularly honored: the Prophet (SAW) taught that
				'Paradise lies at the feet of mothers'. When they reach old age,
				Muslim parents are treated mercifully, with the same kindness and
				selflessness.
			</p>
			<p>
				In Islam, serving one's parents is a duty second only to prayer,
				and it is their right to expect it. It is considered despicable
				to express any irritation when, through no fault of their own,
				the old become difficult.
			</p>
			<p>
				The Quran says: Your Lord has commanded that you worship none but
				Him, and be kind to parents. If either or both of them reach old
				age with you, do not say 'uff' to them or chide them, but speak
				to them in terms of honor and kindness. Treat them with humility,
				and say, 'My Lord! Have mercy on them, for they did care for me
				when I was little'. (17.23-4)

		<section heading="How do Muslims view death?">
			<media type="video" src="icl35.asf" caption="Day of Judgement" narration="Nancy Ali"/>
			<p>
				Like Jews and Christians, Muslims believe that the present life
				is only a trial preparation for the next realm of existence.
				Basic articles of faith include: the Day of Judgement,
				resurrection, Heaven and Hell. When a Muslim dies, he or she is
				washed, usually by a family member, wrapped in a clean white
				cloth, and buried with a simple prayer preferably the same day.
				Muslims consider this one of the final services they can do for
				their relatives, and an opportunity to remember their own brief
				existence here on earth. The Prophet (SAW) taught that three
				things can continue to help a person even after death; charity
				which he had given, knowledge which he had taught and prayers on
				their behalf by a righteous child.

		<section heading="What does Islam say about war?">
			<media type="video" src="icl40.asf" caption="Islam, a positive aspect in society" narration="Abdullah Hakeem"/>
			<p>
Like Christianity, Islam permits fighting in self-defense, in
				defense of religion, or on the part of those who have been
				expelled forcibly from their homes. It lays down strict rules of
				combat which include prohibitions against harming civilians and
				against destroying crops, trees and livestock. As Muslims see it,
				injustice would be triumphant in the world if good men were not
				prepared to risk their lives in a righteous cause. The Quran
				says:
			</p>
			<p>
				'Fight in the cause of God against those who fight you, but do
				not transgress limits. God does not love transgressors.' (2.190)
			</p>
			<p>
				'If they seek peace, then seek you peace. And trust in God for He
				is the One that heareth and knoweth all things.' (8.61)
			</p>
			<p>
				War, therefore, is the last resort, and is subject to the
				rigorous conditions laid down by the sacred law. The term jihad
				literally means 'struggle', and Muslims believe that there are
				two kinds of jihad. The other jihad is the inner struggle which
				everyone wages against egotistic desires, for the sake of
				attaining inner peace.

		<section heading="What about food?">
			<p>
				Although much simpler than the dietary law followed by Jews and

consumption of pig meat or any kind of intoxicating drink. The
				Prophet taught that 'your body has rights over you', and the
				consumption of wholesome food and the leading of a healthy
				lifestyle are seen as religious obligations.
			</p>

		<p>
				It is almost impossible to generalize about American Muslims:
				converts, immigrants, factory workers, doctors; all are making
				their own contribution to America's future. This complex
				community is unified by a common faith, underpinned by a
				countrywide network of a thousand mosques.
			</p>
			<p>
				Muslims were early arrivals in North America. By the eighteenth
				century there were many thousands of them, working as slaves on
				plantations. These early communities, cut off from their heritage
				and families, inevitably lost their Islamic identity as time went
				by. Today many Afro-American Muslims play an important role in
				the Islamic community.
			</p>
			<p>
				The nineteenth century, however, saw the beginnings of an influx
				of Arab Muslims, most of whom settled in the major industrial
				centers where they worshipped in hired rooms. The early twentieth
				century witnessed the arrival of several hundred thousand Muslims
from Eastern Europe: the first Albanian mosque was opened in Maine
				in 1915; others soon followed, and a group of Polish Muslims
				opened a mosque in Brooklyn in 1928.
			</p>
			<p>
				In 1947 the Washington Islamic Center was founded during the term
				of President Truman, and several nationwide organizations were
				set up in the fifties. The same period saw the establishment of
				other communities whose lives were in many ways modeled after
				Islam. More recently, numerous members of these groups have
				entered the fold of Muslim orthodoxy. Today there are about five
				million Muslims in America.

		<p>
			The Islamic world remains today a vast land stretching from the
			Atlantic to the Pacific, with an important presence in Europe and
			America, animated by the teachings of Islam and seeking to assert
			its own identity. Despite the presence of nationalism and various
			secular ideologies in their midst, Muslims wish to live in the
			modern world but without simply imitating blindly the ways
			followed by the West. The Islamic world wishes to live at peace
			with the West as well as the East but at the same time not to be
			dominated by them. It wishes to devote its resources and energies
			to building a better life for its people on the basis of the
			teachings of Islam and not to squander its resources in either
			internal or external conflicts. It seeks finally to create better
			understanding with the West and to be better understood by the
			West. The destinies of the Islamic world and the West cannot be
			totally separated and therefore it is only in understanding each
			other better that they can serve their own people more
			successfully and also contribute to a better life for the whole
			of humanity.
