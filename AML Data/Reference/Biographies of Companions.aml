	<biography name="Said ibn Aamir al-Jumahi">
		<p>
			Said ibn Aamir al-Jumahi was one of thousands who left for the
			region of Tanim on the outskirts of Makkah at the invitation of
			the Quraysh leaders to witness the killing of Khubayb ibn Adiy,
			one of the companions of Muhammad whom they had captured
			treacherously.
		</p>
		<p>
			With his exuberant youthfulness and strength, Said jostled
			through the crowd until he caught up with the Quraysh leaders,
			men like Abu Sufyan ibn Harb. and Safwan ibn Umayyah, who were
			leading the procession.
		</p>
		<p>
			Now he could see the prisoner of the Quraysh shackled in his
			chains, the women and children pushing him to the place set for
			his death. Khubayb's death was to be in revenge for Quraysh
			losses in the battle of Badr.
		</p>
		<p>
			When the assembled throng arrived with its prisoner at the
			appointed place, Said ibn Aamir took up his position at a point
			directly overlooking Khubayb as he approached the wooden cross.
			From there he heard Khubayb's firm but quiet voice amid the
			shouting of women and children.
		</p>
		<p>
			"If you would, leave me to pray two rakaats before my death." 
			This the Quraysh allowed.
		</p>
		<p>
			Said looked at Khubayb as he faced the Kabah and prayed. How
			beautiful and how composed those two rakaats seemed!  Then he saw
			Khubayb facing the Quraysh leaders.
		</p>
		<p>
			"By God, if you thought that I asked to pray out of fear of
			death, I would think the prayer not worth the trouble," he said.
		</p>
		<p>
			Said then saw his people set about dismembering Khubayb's body
			while he was yet alive and taunting him in the process.
		</p>
		<p>
			"Would you like Muhammad to be in your place while you go free?"
		</p>
		<p>
			With his blood flowing, he replied. "By God, I would not want to
			be safe and secure among my family while even a thorn hurts
			Muhammad."  People shook their fists in the air and the shouting
			increased.  "Kill him. Kill him!"
		</p>
		<p>
			Said watched Khubayb lifting his eyes to the heavens above the
			wooden cross.  "Count them all, O Lord," he said. "Destroy them
			and let not a single one escape."
		</p>
		<p>
			Thereafter Said could not count the number of swords and spears
			which cut through Khubayb's body.
		</p>
		<p>
			The Quraysh returned to Makkah and in the eventful days that
			followed forgot Khubayb and his death. But Khubayb was never
			absent from the thoughts of Said, now approaching manhood. Said
			would see him in his dreams while asleep and he would picture
			Khubayb in front of him praying his two rakaats calm and
			contented, before the wooden cross. And he would hear the
			reverberation of Khubayb's voice as he prayed for the punishment
			of the Quraysh. He would become afraid that a thunderbolt from
			the sky or some calamity would strike him.
		</p>
		<p>
			Khubayb, by his death, had taught Said what he did not realize
			before--that real life was faith and conviction and struggle in
			the path of faith, even until death. He taught him also that
			faith which is deeply ingrained in a person works wonders and
			performs miracles. He taught him something else too, that the man
			who is loved by his companions with such a love as Khubayb's
			could only be a prophet with Divine support.
		</p>
		<p>
			Thus was Said's heart opened to Islam. He stood up in the
			assembly of the Quraysh and announced that he was Rex from their
			sins and burdens. He renounced their idols and their
			superstitions and proclaimed his entry into the religion of God.
		</p>
		<p>
			Said ibn Aamir migrated to Madinah and attached himself to the
			Prophet, may the peace and blessings of God be upon him. He took
			part with the Prophet in the battle of Khaybar and other
			engagements thereafter. After the Prophet passed away to the
			protection of his Lord, Said continued active service under his
			two successors, Abu Bakr and Umar. He lived the unique and
			exemplary life of the believer who has purchased the Hereafter
			with this world. He sought the pleasure and blessings of God
			above selfish desires and bodily pleasures.
		</p>
		<p>
			Both Abu Bakr an(l Umar knew Said well for his honesty and piety.
			They would listen to whatever he had to say and follow his
			advice. Said once came to Umar at the beginning of his caliphate
			and said.
		</p>
		<p>
			"I advise you to fear God in dealing with people and do not fear
			people in your relationship with God. Let not your actions
			deviate from your words for the best of speech is that which it
			confirmed by action. Consider those who have been appointed over
			the affairs of Muslims, far and near. Like for them what you like
			for yourself and your family and dislike for them what you would
			dislike for yourself and your family. Surmount any obstacles to
			attain the truth and do not tear the criticisms of those who
			criticize in matters prescribed by God.
		</p>
		<p>
			"Who can measure up to this, Said?" asked Umar.  "A man like
			yourself from among those whom God has appointed over the affairs
			of the Ummah of Muhammad and who feels responsible to God alone,"
			replied Said.
		</p>
		<p>
			"Said," he said, "I appoint you to be governor of Homs (in
			Syria)."  "Umar," pleaded Said, "I entreat you by God, do not
			cause me to go astray by making me concerned with worldly
			affairs."
		</p>
		<p>
			Umar became angry and said, "You have placed the responsibility
			of the caliphate on me and now you forsake me."  "By God. I shall
			not forsake you," Said quickly responded.
		</p>
		<p>
			Umar appointed him as governor of Homs and offered him a
			gratuity.  "What shall I do with it, O Amir al Mumineen?" asked
			Said. "The stipend from the have al-mal will be more than enough
			for my needs." With this, he proceeded to Homs.
		</p>
		<p>
			Not long afterwards, a delegation from Homs made up of people in
			whom Umar had confidence came to visit him in Madinah. He
			requested them to write the names of the poor among them so he
			could relieve their needs. They prepared a list from him in which
			the name Said ibn Aamir appeared.
		</p>
		<p>
			"Who is this Said ibn Aamir?" asked Umar
		</p>
		<p>
			"Our amir" they replied.
		</p>
		<p>
			"Your amir is poor?" said Umar, puzzled.
		</p>
		<p>
			"Yes," they affirmed, "By God, several days go by without a fire
			being lit in his house."
		</p>
		<p>
			Umar was greatly moved and wept. He got a thousand diners, put it
			in a purse and said, "Convey my greetings to him and tell him
			that the Amir al Mumineen has sent this money to help him look
			after his needs."
		</p>
		<p>
			The delegation came to Said with the purse. When he found that it
			contained money, he began to push it away from him, saying, "From
			God we are and to Him we shall certainly return."
		</p>
		<p>
			He said it in such a way as if some misfortune had descended on
			him. His alarmed wife hurried to him and asked, "What's the
			matter, Said? Has the Khalifah died~"
		</p>
		<p>
			"Something greater than that."
		</p>
		<p>
			"Have the Muslims been defeated in a battle?"
		</p>
		<p>
			"Something greater than that. The world has come upon me to
			corrupt my hereafter and create disorder in my house. "
		</p>
		<p>
			"Then get rid of it," said she, not knowing anything about the
			diners.
		</p>
		<p>
			"Will you help me in this?" he asked.
		</p>
		<p>
			She agreed. He took the diners, put them in bags and distributed
			them to the Muslim poor.
		</p>
		<p>
			Not long afterwards, Umar ibn al-Khattab went to Syria to examine
			conditions there. When he arrived at Homs which was called little
			Kufah because, like Kufah, its inhabitants complained a lot about
			their leaders, he asked what they thought of their Amir. They
			complained about him mentioning four of his actions each one more
			serious than the other.
		</p>
		<p>
			"I shall bring you and him together," Umar promised. "And I pray
			to God that my opinion about him would not be damaged. I used to
			have great confidence in him."
		</p>
		<p>
			When the meeting was convened, Umar asked what complaints they
			had against him.
		</p>
		<p>
			"He only comes out to us when the sun is already high," they
			said.
		</p>
		<p>
			"What do you have to say to that, Said?" asked Umar.
		</p>
		<p>
			Said was silent for a moment, then said, "By God, I really didn't
			want to say this but there seems to be no way out. My family does
			not have a home help so I get up every morning and prepare dough
			for bread. I wait a little until it rises and then bake for them.
			I then make wudu and go out to the people."
		</p>
		<p>
			"What's your other complaint?" asked Umar.
		</p>
		<p>
			"He does not answer anyone at night," they said.
		</p>
		<p>
			To this Said reluctantly said, "By God, I really wouldn't have
			liked to disclose this also. but I have left the day for them and
			the night for God, Great and Sublime is He."
		</p>
		<p>
			"And what's your other complaint about him?" asked Umar.
		</p>
		<p>
			"He does not come out to us from one day in every month," they
			said.
		</p>
		<p>
			To this Said replied, "I do not have a home help, O Amir
			al-Mumineen and I do not have any clothes except what's on me.
			This I wash once a month and I wait for it to dry. Then I go out
			in the later part of the day."
		</p>
		<p>
			"Any other complaint about him?" asked Umar.
		</p>
		<p>
			"From time to time, he blacks out in meetings," they said.
		</p>
		<p>
			To this Said replied, "I witnessed the killing of Khubayb ibn
			Adiy when I was a mushrik. I saw the Quraysh cutting him and
			saying, "Would you like Muhammad to be in your place?" to which
			Khubayb replied, "I would not wish to be safe and secure among my
			family while a thorn hurts Muhammad." By God, whenever I remember
			that day and how I failed to come to his aid, I only think that
			God would not forgive me and I black out."
		</p>
		<p>
			Thereupon Umar said, "Praise be to God. My impression of him has
			not been tainted." He later sent a thousand diners to Said to
			help him out. When his wife saw the amount she said. "Praise be
			to God Who has enriched us out of your service. Buy some
			provisions for us and get us a home help."
		</p>
		<p>
			"Is there any way of spending it better?" asked Said. "Let us
			spend it on whoever comes to us and we would get something better
			for it by thus dedicating it to God."  "That will be better," she
			agreed.
		</p>
		<p>
			He put the diners into small bags and said to a member of his
			family, "Take this to the widow of so and so, and the orphans of
			that person, to the needy in that family and to the indigent of
			the family of that person."
		</p>
		<p>
			Said ibn Aamir al-Jumahi was indeed one of those who deny
			themselves even when they are afflicted with severe poverty.
		</p>
	</biography>
	<biography name="Abu Ubaydah ibn al-Jarrah">
		<p>
			His appearance was striking. He was slim and tall. His face was
			bright and he had a sparse beard. It was pleasing to look at him
			and refreshing to meet him. He was extremely courteous and humble
			and quite shy. Yet in a tough situation he would become
			strikingly serious and alert, resembling the flashing blade of a
			sword in his severity and sharpness.
		</p>
		<p>
			He was described as the  Amin  or Custodian of Muhammad's
			community. His full name was Aamir ibn Abdullah ibn al-Jarrah. He
			was known as Abu Ubaydah. Of him Abdullah ibn Umar, one of the
			companions of the Prophet, said:
		</p>
		<p>
			"Three persons in the tribe of Quraysh were most prominent, had
			the best character and were the most modest. If they spoke to
			you, they would not deceive you and if you spoke to them, they
			would not accuse you of Lying: Abu Bakr as-Siddiq, Uthman ibn
			Affan and Abu Ubaydah ibn al-Jarrah."
		</p>
		<p>
			Abu Ubaydah was one of the first persons to accept Islam. He
			became a Muslim one day after Abu Bakr. In fact, it was through
			Abu Bakr that he became a Muslim. Abu Bakr took him, Abdur Rahman
			ibn Aut, Uthman ibn Mazun and al-Arqam ibn Abu al Arqam to the
			Prophet, upon whom be peace, and together they declared their
			acceptance of the Truth. They were thus the first pillars on
			which the great edifice of Islam was built.
		</p>
		<p>
			Abu Ubaydah lived through the harsh experience, which the Muslims
			went through in Makkah, from beginning to end. With the early
			Muslims, he endured the insults and the violence, the pain and
			the sorrow of that experience. In every trial and test he
			remained firm and constant in his belief in God and His prophet.
			One of the most harrowing experiences he had to go through
			however, was at the battle of Badr.
		</p>
		<p>
			Abu Ubaydah was in the vanguard of the Muslim forces, fighting
			with might and main and as someone who was not at all afraid of
			death. The Quraysh cavalry were extremely wary of him and avoided
			coming face to face with him. One man in particular, however,
			kept on pursuing Abu Ubaydah wherever he turned and Abu Ubaydah
			tried his best to keep out of his way and avoid an encounter with
			him.
		</p>
		<p>
			The man plunged into the attack. Abu Ubaydah tried desperately to
			avoid him. Eventually the man succeeded in blocking Abu Ubaydah's
			path and stood as a barrier between him and the Quraysh. I hey
			were now face to face with each other. Abu Ubaydah could not
			contain himself any longer. He struck one blow to the man's head.
			The man fell to the ground and died instantly.
		</p>
		<p>
			Do not try to guess who this man was It was, as stated earlier,
			one of the most harrowing experiences that Abu Ubaydah had to go
			through, how harrowing, it is almost impossible to imagine. The
			man in Fact was Abdullah ibn al-Jarrah, the father of Abu
			Ubaydah!
		</p>
		<p>
			Abu Ubaydah obviously did not want to kill his father but in the
			actual battle between faith in God and polytheism, the choice
			open to him was profoundly disturbing but clear. In a way it
			could be said that he did not kill his father--he only killed the
			polytheism in the person of his father.
		</p>
		<p>
			It is concerning this event that God revealed the following
			verses of the Quran:
		</p>
		<p>
			"You will not find a people believing in God and the Last Day
			making friends with those who oppose God and His messenger even
			if these were their fathers, their sons, their brothers or their
			clan. God has placed faith in their hearts and strengthened them
			with a spirit from Him. He will cause them to enter gardens
			beneath which streams flow that they may dwell therein. God is
			well pleased with them and they well pleased with Him. They are
			the party of God. Is not the party of God the successful ones?"
			(Surah al-Mujactilah 58:22)
		</p>
		<p>
			The response of Abu Ubaydah at Badr when confronted by his father
			was not unexpected. He had attained a strength of faith in God,
			devotion to His religion and a level of concern for the ummah of
			Muhammad to which many aspired.
		</p>
		<p>
			It is related by Muhammad ibn Jafar, a Companion of the Prophet,
			that a Christian delegation came to the Prophet and said, 'O
			Abu-l Qasim, send one of your companions with us, one in whom you
			are well pleased, to judge between us on some questions of
			property about which we disagree among ourselves. We have a high
			regard for you Muslim people."
		</p>
		<p>
			"Come back to me this evening," replied the Prophet, "and I will
			send with you one who is strong and trustworthy."
		</p>
		<p>
			Umar ibn al-Khattab heard the Prophet saying this and later said:
			 "I went to the Zuhr (midday) Prayer early hoping to be the one
			who would fit the description of the Prophet. When the Prophet
			had finished the Prayer, he began looking to his right and his
			left and I raised myself so that he could see me. But he
			continued looking among us until he spotted Abu Ubaydah ibn
			al-Jarrah. He called him and said, 'Go with them and judge among
			them with truth about that which they are in disagreement." And
			so Abu Ubaydah got the appointment."
		</p>
		<p>
			Abu Ubaydah was not only trustworthy. He displayed a great deal
			of strength in the discharge of his trust. This strength was
			shown on several occasions.
		</p>
		<p>
			One day the Prophet dispatched a group of his Sahabah to meet a
			Quraysh caravan. He appointed Abu Ubaydah as amir (leader) of the
			group and gave them a bag of dates and nothing else as
			provisions. Abu Ubaydah gave to each man under his command only
			one date every day. He would suck this date just as a child would
			suck at the breast of its mother. He would then drink some water
			and this would suffice him for the whole day.
		</p>
		<p>
			On the day of Uhud when the Muslims were being routed, one of the
			mushrikeen started to shout, "Show me Muhammad, show me
			Muhammad." Abu Ubaydah was one of a group of ten Muslims who had
			encircled the Prophet to protect him against the spears of the
			Mushrikeen.
		</p>
		<p>
			When the battle was over, it was found that one of the Prophet's
			molar teeth was broken, his forehead was bashed in and two discs
			from his shield had penetrated into his cheeks. Abu Bakr went
			forward with the intention of extracting these discs but Abu
			Ubaydah said, "Please leave that to me."
		</p>
		<p>
			Abu Ubaydah was afraid that he would cause the Prophet pain if he
			took out the discs with his hand. He bit hard into one of the
			discs. It was extracted but one of his incisor teeth fell to the
			ground in the process. With his other incisor, he extracted the
			other disc but lost that tooth also. Abu Bakr remarked, "Abu
			Ubaydah is the best of men at breaking incisor teeth!"
		</p>
		<p>
			Abu Ubaydah continued to be fully involved in all the momentous
			events during the Prophet's lifetime. After the beloved Prophet
			had passed away, the companions gathered to choose a successor at
			the Saqifah or meeting place of Banu Saaadah. The day is known in
			history as the Day of Saqifah. On this day, Umar ibn al-Khattab
			said to Abu Ubaydah, "Stretch forth your hand and I will swear
			allegiance to you for I heard the Prophet, peace be upon him say,
			'Every ummah has an amin (custodian) and you are the amin of this
			ummah.' "
		</p>
		<p>
			"I would not," declared Abu Ubaydah, "put myself forward in the
			presence of a man whom the Prophet, upon whom be peace, commanded
			to lead us in Prayer and who led us right until the Prophet's
			death." He then gave bayah (the oath of allegiance) to Abu Bakr
			as-Siddiq. He continued to be a close adviser to Abu Bakr and his
			strong supporter in the cause of truth and goodness. Then came
			the caliphate of Umar and Abu Ubaydah also gave him his support
			and obedience. He did not disobey him in any matter, except one.
		</p>
		<p>
			The incident happened when Abu Ubaydah was in Syria leading the
			Muslim forces from one victory to another until the whole of
			Syria was under Muslim control. The River Euphrates lay to his
			right and Asia Minor to his left.
		</p>
		<p>
			It was then that a plague hit the land of Syria, the like of
			which people had never experienced before. It devastated the
			population. Umar dispatched a messenger to Abu Ubaydah with a
			letter saying:
		</p>
		<p>
			"I am in urgent need of you. If my letter reaches you at night I
			strongly urge you to leave before dawn. If this letter reaches
			you during the day, I strongly urge you to leave before evening
			and hasten to me.
		</p>
		<p>
			When Abu Ubaydah received Umar's letter, he said, "I know why the
			Amir al-Mumineen needs me. He wants to secure the survival of
			someone who, however, is not eternal." So he wrote to Umar:
		</p>
		<p>
			"I know that you need me. But I am in an army of Muslims and I
			have no desire to save myself from what is afflicting them. I do
			not want to separate from them until God wills. So, when this
			letter reaches you, release me from your command and permit me to
			stay on.''
		</p>
		<p>
			When Umar read this letter tears filled his eyes and those who
			were with him asked, "Has Abu Ubaydah died, O Amir al-Mumineen?"
		</p>
		<p>
			"No," said he, "But death is near to him."
		</p>
		<p>
			Umar's intuition was not wrong. Before long, Abu Ubaydah became
			afflicted with the plague. As death hung over him, he spoke to
			his army:
		</p>
		<p>
			"Let me give you some advice which will cause you to be on the
			path of goodness always.  "Establish Prayer. Fast the month of
			Ramadan. Give Sadaqah. Perform the Hajj and Umrah. Remain united
			and support one another. Be sincere to your commanders and do not
			conceal anything from them. Don't let the world destroy you for
			even if man were to live a thousand years he would still end up
			with this state that you see me in.
		</p>
		<p>
			Peace be upon you and the mercy of God."
		</p>
		<p>
			Abu Ubaydah then turned to Muadh ibn Jabal and said, "O Muadh,
			perform the prayer with the people (be their leader)." At this,
			his pure soul departed.  Muadh got up and said:
		</p>
		<p>
			"O people, you are stricken by the death of a man. By God, I
			don't know whether I have seen a man who had a more righteous
			heart, who was further from all evil and who was more sincere to
			people than he. Ask God to shower His mercy on him and God will
			be merciful to you. "

	<biography name="Khabbab ibn al-Aratt">
		<p>
			A woman named Umm Anmaar who belonged to the Khuza-a tribe in
			Makkah went to the slave market in the city. She wanted to buy
			herself a youth for her domestic chores and to exploit his labor
			for economic gains. As she scrutinized the faces of those who
			were displayed for sale, her eyes fell ON a boy who was obviously
			not yet in his teens. She saw that he was strong and healthy and
			that there were clear signs of intelligence on his face. She
			needed no further incentive to purchase him. She paid and walked
			away with her new acquisition.
		</p>
		<p>
			On the way home, Umm Anmaar turned to the boy and said:
		</p>
		<p>
			"What's your name, boy?''
		</p>
		<p>
			"Khabbah."
		</p>
		<p>
			"And what's your father's name'?''
		</p>
		<p>
			"Al-Aratt. "
		</p>
		<p>
			"Where do you come from?"
		</p>
		<p>
			"From Najd."
		</p>
		<p>
			"Then you are an Arab!"
		</p>
		<p>
			"Yes, from the Banu Tamim."
		</p>
		<p>
			"How then did you come into the hands of the slave dealers in
			Makkah?"
		</p>
		<p>
			"One of the Arab tribes raided our territory. They took our
			cattle and captured women and children. I was among the youths
			captured. I passed from one hand to another until I ended up in
			Makkah . . ."
		</p>
		<p>
			Umm Anmaar placed the youth as an apprentice to one of the
			blacksmiths in Makkah to learn the art of making swords. The
			youth learnt quickly and was soon an expert at the profession.
			When he was strong enough, Umm Anmaar set up a workshop for him
			with all the necessary tools and equipment from making swords.
			Before long he was quite famous in Makkah for his excellent
			craftsmanship. People also liked dealing with him because of his
			honesty and integrity. Umm Anmaar gained much profit through him
			and exploited his talents to the full.
		</p>
		<p>
			In spite of his youthfulness, Khabbab displayed unique
			intelligence and wisdom. Often, when he had finished work and was
			left to himself, he would reflect deeply on the state of Arabian
			society which was so steeped in corruption. He was appalled at
			the aimless wandering, the ignorance and the tyranny which he
			saw. He was one of the victims of this tyranny and he would say
			to himself:
		</p>
		<p>
			"After this night of darkness, there must be a dawn." And he
			hoped that he would live long enough to see the darkness
			dissipate with the steady glow and brightness of new light.
		</p>
		<p>
			Khabbab did not have to wait long. He was privileged to be in
			Makkah when the first rays of the light of Islam penetrated the
			city. It emanated from the lips of Muhammad ibn Abdullah as he
			announced that none deserves to be worshipped or adored except
			the Creator and Sustainer of the universe. He called for an end
			to injustice and oppression and sharply criticized the practices
			of the rich in accumulating wealth at the expense of the poor and
			the outcast. He denounced aristocratic privileges and attitudes
			and called for a new order based on respect for human dignity and
			compassion for the underprivileged including orphans, wayfarers
			and the needy.
		</p>
		<p>
			To Khabbab, the teachings of Muhammad were like a powerful light
			dispelling the darkness of ignorance. He went and listened to
			these teachings directly from him. Without any hesitation he
			stretched out his hand to the Prophet in allegiance and testified
			that "There is no god but Allah and Muhammad is His servant and
			His messenger." He was among the first ten persons to accept
			Islam .
		</p>
		<p>
			Khabbab did not hide his acceptance of Islam from anyone. When
			the news of his becoming a Muslim reached Umm Anmaar, she became
			incensed with anger. She went to her brother Sibaa ibn Abd
			al-Uzza who gathered a gang of youths from the Khuzaa tribe and
			together they made their way to Khabbab. They found him
			completely engrossed in his work. Sibaa went up to him and said:
		</p>
		<p>
			"We have heard some news from you which we don't believe."
		</p>
		<p>
			"What is it?" asked Khabbab.
		</p>
		<p>
			"We have been told that you have given up your religion and that
			you now follow that man from the Banu Ha shim ."
		</p>
		<p>
			"I have not given up my religion" replied Khabbab calmly. "I only
			believe in One God Who has no partner. I reject your idols and I
			believe that Muhammad is the servant of God and His messenger."
		</p>
		<p>
			No sooner had Khabbab spoken these words than Sibaa and his gang
			set upon him. They beat him with their fists and with iron bars
			and they kicked him until he fell unconscious to the ground, with
			blood streaming from the wounds he received.
		</p>
		<p>
			The news of what happened between Khabbab and his slave mistress
			spread throughout Makkah like wild-fire. People were astonished
			at Khabbab's daring. They had not yet heard of anyone who
			followed Muhammad and who had the audacity to announce the fact
			with such frankness and deviant confidence.
		</p>
		<p>
			The Khabbab affair shook the leaders of the Quraysh. They did not
			expect that a blacksmith, such as belonged to Umm Anmaar and who
			had no clan in Makkah to protect him and no asabiyyah to prevent
			him from injury, would be bold enough to go outside her
			authority, denounce her gods and reject the religion of her
			forefathers. They realized that this was only the beginning . . .
		</p>
		<p>
			The Quraysh were not wrong in their expectations. Khabbab's
			courage impressed many of his friends and encouraged them to
			announce their acceptance of Islam. One after another, they began
			to proclaim publicly the message of truth.
		</p>
		<p>
			In the precincts of the Haram, near the Kabah, the Quraysh
			leaders gathered to discuss the problem of Muhammad. Among them
			were Abu Sufyan ibn Harb, al Walid ibn al-Mughira and Abu Jahl
			ibn Hisham. They noted that Muhammad was getting stronger and
			that his following was increasing day by day, indeed hour by
			hour. To them this was like a terrible disease and they made up
			their minds to stop it before it got out of control. They decided
			that each tribe should get hold of any follower of Muhammad among
			them and punish him until he either recants his faith or dies.
		</p>
		<p>
			On Sibaa ibn Abd al-Uzza and his people fell the task of
			punishing Khabbab even further. Regularly they began taking him
			to all open area in the city when the sun was at its zenith and
			the ground was scorching hot. They would take off his clothes and
			dress him in iron armor and lay him on the ground. In the intense
			heat his skin would be seared and hit body would become inert.
			When it appeared that all strength had let him, they would come
			up and challenge him:
		</p>
		<p>
			"What do you say about Muhammad'?"
		</p>
		<p>
			"He is the servant of God and His messenger. He has come with the
			religion of guidance and truth, to lead us from darkness into
			light."
		</p>
		<p>
			They would become more furious and intensify their beating. They
			would ask about al-Laat and al-Uzza and he would reply firmly:
		</p>
		<p>
			"Two idols, deaf and dumb, that cannot cause harm or bring any
			benefit..."
		</p>
		<p>
			This enraged them even more and they would take a big hot stone
			and place it on his back. Khabbab's pain and anguish would be
			excruciating but he did not recant.
		</p>
		<p>
			The inhumanity of Umm Anmaar towards Khabbab was not less than
			that of her brother. Once she saw the Prophet speaking to Khabbab
			at his workshop and she flew into a blind rage. Every day after
			that, for several days, she went to Khabbab's workshop and
			punished him by placing a red hot iron from the furnace on his
			head. The agony was unbearable and he often fainted.
		</p>
		<p>
			Khabbab suffered long and his only recourse was to prayer. He
			prayed for the punishment of Umm Anmaar and her brother. His
			release from pain and suffering only came when the Prophet, peace
			be upon him, gave permission to his companions to emigrate to
			Madinah. Umm Anmaar by then could not prevent him from going. She
			herself became afflicted with a terrible illness which no one had
			heard of before. She behaved as if she had suffered a rabid
			attack. The headaches she had were especially nerve-racking. Her
			children sought everywhere for medical help until finally they
			were told that the only cure was to cauterize her head. This was
			done. The treatment, with a ret hot iron, was more terrible than
			all the headaches she suffered.
		</p>
		<p>
			At Madinah, among the generous and hospitable Ansar, Khabbab
			experienced a state of ease and restfulness which he had not
			known for a long time. He was delighted to be near the Prophet,
			peace be upon him, with no one to molest him or disturb his
			happiness.
		</p>
		<p>
			He fought alongside the noble Prophet at the battle of Badr. He
			participated in the battle of Uhud where he had the satisfaction
			of seeing Sibaa ibn Abd al-Uzza meet his end at the hands of
			Hamza ibn Abd al-Muttalib, the uncle of the Prophet.
		</p>
		<p>
			Khabbab lived long enough to witness the great expansion of Islam
			under the four Khulafaa arRashidun--Abu Bakr, Umar, Uthman and
			Ali. He once visited Umar during his caliphate. Umar stood up--he
			was in a meeting--and greeted Khabbab with the words:
		</p>
		<p>
			"No one is more deserving than you to be in this assembly other
			than Bilal."  He asked Khabbab about the torture and the
			persecution he had received at the hands of the mushrikeen.
			Khabbab described this in some detail since it was still very
			vivid in his mind. He then exposed his back and even Umar was
			aghast at what he saw.
		</p>
		<p>
			In the last phase of his life, Khabbab was blessed with wealth
			such as he had never before dreamed of. He was, however,
			well-known for his generosity. It is even said that he placed his
			dirhams and his diners in a part of his house that was known to
			the poor and the needy. He did not secure this money in any way
			and those in need would come and take what they needed without
			seeking any permission or asking any questions.
		</p>
		<p>
			In spite of this, he was always afraid of his accountability to
			God for the way he disposed of this wealth. A group of companions
			related that they visited Khabbab when he was sick and he said:
		</p>
		<p>
			"In this place there are eighty thousand dirhams. By God, I have
			never secured it any way and I have not barred anyone in need
			from it."
		</p>
		<p>
			He wept and they asked why he was weeping.
		</p>
		<p>
			"I weep," he said, "because my companions have passed away and
			they did not obtain any such reward in this world. I have lived
			on and have acquired this wealth and I fear that this will be the
			only reward for my deeds."
		</p>
		<p>
			Soon after he passed away. The Khalifah Ali ibn Abu Talib, may
			God be pleased with him, stood at his grave and said:
		</p>
		<p>
			"May God have mercy on Khabbab. He accepted Islam wholeheartedly.
			He performed hijrah willingly. He lived as a mujahid and God
			shall not withhold the reward of one who has done good."

	<biography name="At-Tufayl ibn Amr ad-Dawsi">
		<p>
			At-Tufayl ibn Amr was the chief of the Daws tribe in preQuranic
			times and a distinguished Arab notable known for his manly
			virtues and good works.
		</p>
		<p>
			He fed the hungry, comforted those in distress and granted asylum
			to refugees. He was also keenly interested in literature and was
			himself a sharp and sensitive poet capable of expressing the most
			delicate emotions.
		</p>
		<p>
			Tufayl left the hearths of his village in Tihama in the south of
			the Arabian peninsula and set out for Makkah. The struggle
			between the noble Prophet and the disbelieving Quraysh was
			already at its height. Each wanted to gain support for his cause
			and recruit helpers. The Prophet, peace and blessings of God be
			on him, sought help from his Lord. His weapons were faith and
			truth. The disbelieving Quraysh resisted his message with every
			weapon, and attempted to keep people away from it by all the
			means at their disposal.
		</p>
		<p>
			Tufayl found himself entering this battle without any preparation
			or warning. He did not come to Makkah to get involved in it.
			Indeed he was not aware of the struggle that was taking place.
		</p>
		<p>
			Let Tufayl himself take up the story from this point:
		</p>
		<p>
			I approached Makkah. As soon as the Quraysh leaders saw me, they
			came up to me and gave me a most hearty welcome and accommodated
			me in a grand house. Their leaders and notables then gathered and
			said:
		</p>
		<p>
			"O Tufayl, you have come to our town. This man who claims that he
			is a Prophet has ruined our authority and shattered our
			community. We are afraid that he would succeed in undermining you
			and your authority among your people just as he has done with us.
			Don't speak to the man. On no account listen to anything he has
			to say. He has the speech of a wizard, causing division between
			father and son, between brother and brother and between husband
			and wife."
		</p>
		<p>
			They went on telling me the most fantastic stories and scared me
			by recounting tales of his incredible deeds. I made up my mind
			then not to approach this man, or speak to him or listen to
			anything he had to say.
		</p>
		<p>
			The following morning I went to the Sacred Mosque to make tawaf
			around the Kabah as an act of worship to the idols that we made
			pilgrimage to and glorified. I inserted a piece of cotton in my
			ears out of fear that something of the speech of Muhammad would
			reach my hearing. As soon as I entered the Mosque, I saw him
			standing near the Kabah. He was praying in a fashion which was
			different from our prayer. His whole manner of worship was
			different. The scene captivated me. His worship made me tremble
			and I felt drawn to him, despite myself, until I was quite close
			to him.
		</p>
		<p>
			Not withstanding the precaution I had taken, God willed that some
			of what he was saying should reach my hearing and I heard a
			speech that was so beautiful that I said to myself, "What are you
			doing, Tufayl? You are a perceptive poet. You can distinguish
			between the good and the bad in poetry. What prevents you from
			listening to what this man is saying? If what comes from him is
			good, accept it, and if it is bad, reject it."
		</p>
		<p>
			I remained there until the Prophet left for his home. I followed
			him as he entered his house, and I entered also and said, "O
			Muhammad, your people have said certain things to me about you.
			By God, they kept on frightening me away from your message so
			that I even blocked my ears to keep out your words. Despite this,
			God caused me to hear something of it and I found it good. So
			tell me more about your mission."
		</p>
		<p>
			The Prophet, peace be upon him, did and recited to me Surah
			Al-Iklaas and Surah Al-Falaq. I swear by God, I had never heard
			such beautiful words before. Neither was a more noble or just
			mission ever described to me. Thereupon, I stretched out my hand
			to him in allegiance and testified that there is no god but Allah
			and that Muhammad is the messenger of Allah. This is how I
			entered Islam.
		</p>
		<p>
			I stayed on for some time in Makkah learning the teachings of
			Islam memorizing parts of the Quran. When I decided to return to
			my people, I said, "O Rasulullah. I am a man who is obeyed in his
			tribe. I am going back to them and I shall invite them to Islam .
			. ."
		</p>
		<p>
			When I returned to my people, my father, who was quite old then,
			came up to me and I said, 'O Father, let me relate my news to
			you. I am no longer from you and you are not of me.''
		</p>
		<p>
			"Why so, my son?" he asked.
		</p>
		<p>
			"I have accepted Islam and now follow the religion of Muhammad,
			peace and blessings of God be upon him," I replied.
		</p>
		<p>
			"My son," he said, "your religion is my religion."
		</p>
		<p>
			''Go and wash your sell and cleanse your clothes," I said. "Then
			come that I may teach you what I have learnt."
		</p>
		<p>
			This the old man did and I explained Islam to him and he became a
			Muslim.
		</p>
		<p>
			"Then came my wife and I said, "Let me relate my news to you. I
			am no longer of you and you are not of me."
		</p>
		<p>
			"Good heavens! Why so?" she exclaimed.
		</p>
		<p>
			"Islam has separated us," I explained. "I have become a Muslim
			and follow the religion of Muhammad."
		</p>
		<p>
			"Your religion is my religion," she replied.
		</p>
		<p>
			'Then go and purify yourself, not with the water of Dhu Shara,
			the idol of the Daws, but with pure water from the mountain. "
		</p>
		<p>
			"Good gracious! Do you fear anything from Dhu Shara?"
		</p>
		<p>
			"Damn Dhu Shari. I told you, go and wash there, far away from
			people. I guarantee you that this dumb stone won't do a thing to
			you."
		</p>
		<p>
			She went and washed and I explained Islam to her and she became a
			Muslim. I then invited the Daws as a whole to become Muslims.
			They were all slow in responding, except Abu Hurayrah. He was the
			quickest to respond to the invitation of Islam.
		</p>
		<p>
			The next time I went to Makkah, Abu Hurayrah was with me.
		</p>
		<p>
			"What have you left behind?' the Prophet asked me.
		</p>
		<p>
			"Hearts with veils over them obscuring the Truth, and firm
			disbelief. Sin and disobedience have won over the Daws."
		</p>
		<p>
			The Prophet thereupon stood up, made wudu and prayed with his
			hands raised to the heavens. Abu Hurayrah remarked, "When I saw
			the Prophet like this, I was afraid that he was praying against
			my people and that they would be destroyed."
		</p>
		<p>
			But the Prophet, upon whom be peace, prayed, "O Lord, guide the
			Daws, guide the Daws, guide the Daws." Then he turned to me and
			said:
		</p>
		<p>
			"Go back to your people, befriend them, treat them gently and
			invite them to Islam."
		</p>
		<p>
			I stayed in the land of the Daws inviting them to Islam until
			after the hijrah of the Prophet to Madinah and after the battle
			of Badr, Uhud and Khandaq had taken place. Then I went to the
			Prophet. With me were eighty families who had become Muslims and
			who were strong in their faith. The Prophet was pleased with us
			and he gave us a portion of the booty after the battle of
			Khaybar. We said to him, "O Rasulullah, make us the right wing of
			your army in every battle and make our efforts acceptable."
		</p>
		<p>
			Tufayl stayed with the Prophet until the liberation of Makkah.
			After the destruction of the idols there, Tufayl asked the
			Prophet to send him to put an end to the worship of Dhu-l Kafayn,
			the chief idol of his people. The Prophet gave him permission.
		</p>
		<p>
			Back in Tihama among the Daws, men, women and children of the
			tribe had gathered and were agitated that the idol was going to
			be burnt. They were waiting to see if any evil would befall
			Tufayl should he harm Dhu-l Kafayn. Tufayl approached the idols
			with the worshipers around it. As he set fire to it, he
			proclaimed:
		</p>
		<p>
			"O Dhu-l Kafayn, of your worshipers I certainly am not.
		</p>
		<p>
			Fire have I inserted into your heart."
		</p>
		<p>
			Whatever shirk remained in the Daws tribe went up in the flames
			that burnt the idol. The whole tribe became Muslims.
		</p>
		<p>
			Tufayl remained a lieutenant of the Prophet until the noble
			messenger passed away. Tufayl then placed himself in the service
			of the Khalifah Abu Bakr, the successor of the Prophet. During
			the Riddah wars, he led a contingent of his people against the
			impostor Musaylamah.
		</p>
		<p>
			In the battle of al-Yamamah that followed, the dear companion of
			the Prophet, Tufayl ibn Amr fought hard but eventually fell as a
			martyr on the battlefield.

	<biography name="Abu Dharr al-Ghifari">
		<p>
			In the Waddan valley which connects Makkah with the outside
			world, lived the tribe of Ghifar. The Ghifar existed on the
			meagre offerings of the trade caravans of the Quraysh which plied
			between Syria and Makkah. It is likely that they also lived by
			raiding these caravans when they were not given enough to satisfy
			their needs.  Jundub ibn Junadah, nicknamed Abu Dharr, was a
			member of this tribe.
		</p>
		<p>
			He was known for his courage, his calmness and his far
			sightedness and also for the repugnance he felt against the idols
			which his people worshipped. He rejected the silly religious
			beliefs and the religious corruption in which the Arabs were
			engaged.
		</p>
		<p>
			While he was in the Waddan desert, news reached Abu Dharr that a
			new Prophet had appeared in Makkah. He really hoped that his
			appearance would help to change the hearts and minds of people
			and lead them away from the darkness of superstition. Without
			wasting much time, he called his brother, Anis, and said to him:
		</p>
		<p>
			"Go to Makkah and get whatever news you can of this man who
			claims that he is a Prophet and that revelation comes to him from
			the heavens. Listen to some of his sayings and come back and
			recite them to me."
		</p>
		<p>
			Anis went to Makkah and met the Prophet, peace and blessings of
			God be on him. He listened to what he had to say and returned to
			the Waddan desert. Abu Dharr met him and anxiously asked for news
			of the Prophet.
		</p>
		<p>
			"I have seen a man," reported Anis, 'who calls people to
		</p>
		<p>
			noble qualities and there is no mere poetry in what he says."
		</p>
		<p>
			"What do people say about him?" asked Abu Dharr.
		</p>
		<p>
			"They say he is a magician, a soothsayer and a poet."
		</p>
		<p>
			"My curiosity is not satisfied. I am not finished with this
			matter. Will you look after my family while I go out and examine
			this prophet's mission myself?"
		</p>
		<p>
			"Yes. But beware of the Makkans."
		</p>
		<p>
			On his arrival at Makkah, Abu Dharr immediately felt very
			apprehensive and he decided to exercise great caution. The
			Quraysh were noticeably angry over the denunciation of their
			gods. Abu Dharr heard of the terrible violence they were meting
			out to the followers of the Prophet but this was what he
			expected. He therefore refrained from asking anyone about
			Muhammad not knowing whether that person might be a follower or
			an enemy.
		</p>
		<p>
			At nightfall, he lay down in the Sacred Mosque. Ali ibn Abi Talib
			passed by him and, realizing that he was a stranger, asked him to
			come to his house. Abu Dharr spent the night with him and in the
			morning took his water pouch and his bag containing provisions
			and returned to the Mosque. He had asked no questions and no
			questions were asked of him.
		</p>
		<p>
			Abu Dharr spent the following day without getting to know the
			Prophet. At evening he went to the Mosque to sleep and Ali again
			passed by him and said:
		</p>
		<p>
			"Isn't it time that a man knows his house?"
		</p>
		<p>
			Abu Dharr accompanied him and stayed at his house a second night.
			Again no one asked the other about anything.
		</p>
		<p>
			On the third night, however, Ali asked him, "Aren't you going to
			tell me why you came to Makkah?"
		</p>
		<p>
			"Only if you will give me an undertaking that you will guide me
			to what I seek."  Ali agreed and Abu Dharr said:  "I came to
			Makkah from a distant place seeking a meeting with the new
			Prophet and to listen to some of what he has to say."
		</p>
		<p>
			Ali's face lit up with happiness as he said, "By God, he is
			really the Messenger of God," and he went on telling Abu Dharr
			more about the Prophet and his teaching. Finally, he said:
		</p>
		<p>
			"When we get up in the morning, follow me wherever I go. If I see
			anything which I am afraid of for your sake, I would stop as if
			to pass water. If I continue, follow me until you enter where I
			enter."
		</p>
		<p>
			Abu Dharr did not sleep a wink the rest of that night because of
			his intense longing to see the Prophet and listen to the words of
			revelation. In the morning, he followed closely in Ali's
			footsteps until they were in the presence of the Prophet.
		</p>
		<p>
			As-salaamu Alayka Yaa Rasulullah, (Peace be on you, O Messenger
			of God)," greeted Abu Dharr.
		</p>
		<p>
			Wa Alayka salaamullahi wa rahmatuhu wa barakaatuhu (And on you be
			the peace of God, His mercy and His blessings)," replied the
			Prophet.
		</p>
		<p>
			Abu Dharr was thus the first person to greet the Prophet with the
			greeting of Islam. After that, the greeting spread and came into
			general use.
		</p>
		<p>
			The Prophet, peace be on him, welcomed Abu Dharr and invited him
			to Islam. He recited some of the Quran for him. Before long, Abu
			Dharr pronounced the Shahadah thus entering the new religion
			(without even leaving his place). He was among the first persons
			to accept Islam.
		</p>
		<p>
			Let us leave Abu Dharr to continue his own story...
		</p>
		<p>
			After that I stayed with the Prophet in Makkah and he taught me
			Islam and taught me to read the Quran. Then he said to me, 'Don't
			tell anyone in Makkah about your acceptance of Islam. I fear that
			they will kill you."
		</p>
		<p>
			"By Him in whose hands is my soul, I shall not leave Makkah until
			I go to the Sacred Mosque and proclaim the call of Truth in the
			midst of the Quraysh," vowed Abu Dharr.
		</p>
		<p>
			The Prophet remained silent. I went to the Mosque. The Quraysh
			were sitting and talking. I went in their midst and called out at
			the top of my voice, "O people of Quraysh, I testify that there
			is no God but Allah and that Muhammad is the messenger of Allah."
		</p>
		<p>
			My words had an immediate effect on them. They jumped up and
			said, 'Get this one who has left his religion." They pounced on
			me and began to beat me mercilessly. They clearly meant to kill
			me. But Abbas ibn Abdulmuttalib, the uncle of the Prophet,
			recognized me. He bent over and protected me from them. He told
			them:
		</p>
		<p>
			"Woe to you! Would you kill a man from the Ghifar tribe and your
			caravans must pass through their territory?"  They then released
			me.
		</p>
		<p>
			I went back to the Prophet, upon whom be peace, and when he saw
			my condition, he said, "Didn't I tell you not to announce your
			acceptance of Islam?"  "O Messenger of God," I said, "It was a
			need I felt in my soul and I fulfilled it."  "Go to your people,"
			he commanded, "and tell them what you have seen and heard. Invite
			them to God. Maybe God will bring them good through you and
			reward you through them. And when you hear that I have come out
			in the open, then come to me."
		</p>
		<p>
			I left and went back to my people. My brother came up to me and
			asked, "What have you done?" I told him that I had become a
			Muslim and that I believed in the truth of Muhammad's teachings.
		</p>
		<p>
			"I am not averse to your religion. In fact, I am also now a
			Muslim and a believer," he said.
		</p>
		<p>
			We both went to our mother then and invited her to Islam .
		</p>
		<p>
			"I do not have any dislike from your religion. I accept Islam
			also," she said.
		</p>
		<p>
			From that day this family of believers went out tirelessly
			inviting the Ghifar to God and did not flinch from their purpose.
			Eventually a large number became Muslims and the congregational
			Prayer was instituted among them.
		</p>
		<p>
			Abu Dharr remained in his desert abode until after the Prophet
			had gone to Madinah and the battles of Badr, Uhud and Khandaq had
			been fought. At Madinah at last, he asked the Prophet to be in
			his personal service. The Prophet agreed and was pleased with his
			companionship and service. He sometimes showed preference to Abu
			Dharr above others and whenever he met him he would pat him and
			smile and show his happiness.
		</p>
		<p>
			After the death of the Prophet, Abu Dharr could not bear to stay
			in Madinah because of grief and the knowledge that there was to
			be no more of his guiding company. So he left for the Syrian
			desert and stayed there during the caliphate of Abu Bakr and
			Umar.
		</p>
		<p>
			During the caliphate of Uthman, he stayed in Damascus and saw the
			Muslims concern for the world and their consuming desire for
			luxury. He was saddened and repelled by this. So Uthman asked him
			to come to Madinah. At Madinah he was also critical of the
			people's pursuit of worldly goods and pleasures and they were
			critical in turn of his reviling them. Uthman therefore ordered
			that he should go to Rubdhah, a small village near Madinah. There
			he stayed far away from people, renouncing their preoccupation
			with worldly goods and holding on to the legacy of the Prophet
			and his companions in seeking the everlasting abode of the
			Hereafter in preference to this transitory world.
		</p>
		<p>
			Once a man visited him and began looking at the contents of his
			house but found it quite bare. He asked Abu Dharr:  "Where are
			your possessions?"  "We have a house yonder (meaning the
			Hereafter)," said Abu Dharr, "to which we send the best of our
			possessions."  The man understood what he meant and said:  "But
			you must have some possessions so long as you are in this abode."
			 "The owner of this abode will not leave us in it," replied Abu
			Dharr.
		</p>
		<p>
			Abu Dharr persisted in his simple and frugal life to the end.
			Once the amir of Syria sent three hundred diners to Abu Dharr to
			meet his needs. He returned the money saying, "Does not the amir
			of Syria find a servant more deserving of it than I?"
		</p>
		<p>
			In the year 32 AH. the self-denying Abu Dharr passed away. The
			Prophet, peace be upon him, had said of him:  "The earth does not
			carry nor the heavens cover a man more true and faithful than Abu
			Dharr."

	<biography name="Umm Salamah">
		<p>
			Umm Salamah! What an eventful life she had! Her real name was
			Hind. She was the daughter of one of the notables in the Makhzum
			clan nicknamed "Zad ar-Rakib" because he was well known for his
			generosity particularly to travelers. Umm Salamah's husband was
			Abdullah ibn Abdulasad and they both were among the first persons
			to accept Islam. Only Abu Bakr and a few others, who could be
			counted on the fingers of one hand, became Muslims before them.
		</p>
		<p>
			As soon as the news of their becoming Muslims spread, the Quraysh
			reacted with frenzied anger. They began hounding and persecuting
			Umm Salamah and her husband. But the couple did not waver or
			despair and remained steadfast in their new faith.
		</p>
		<p>
			The persecution became more and more intense. Life in Makkah
			became unbearable for many of the new Muslims. The Prophet, peace
			be upon him, then gave permission for them to emigrate to
			Abyssinia. Umm Salamah and her husband were in the forefront of
			these muhajirun, seekers of refuge in a strange land. For Umm
			Salamah it meant abandoning her spacious home and giving up the
			traditional ties of lineage and honor for something new, hope in
			the pleasure and reward of Allah.
		</p>
		<p>
			Despite the protection Umm Salamah and her companions received
			from the Abyssinian ruler, the desire to return to Makkah, to be
			near the Prophet and the source of revelation and guidance
			persisted.
		</p>
		<p>
			News eventually reached the muhajirun that the number of Muslims
			in Makkah had increased. Among them were Hamzah ibn Abdulmuttalib
			and Umar ibn al-Khattab. Their faith had greatly strengthened the
			community and the Quraysh they heard, had eased the persecution
			somewhat. Thus a group of the muhajirun, urged on by a deep
			longing in their hearts, decided to return to Makkah.
		</p>
		<p>
			The easing of the persecution was but brief as the returnees soon
			found out. The dramatic increase in the number of Muslims
			following the acceptance of Islam by Hamzah and Umar only
			infuriated the Quraysh even more. They intensified their
			persecution and torture to a pitch and intensity not known
			before. So the Prophet gave permission to his companions to
			emigrate to Madinah. Umm Salamah and her husband were among the
			first to leave.
		</p>
		<p>
			The hijrah of Umm Salamah and her husband though was not as easy
			as they had imagined. In fact, it was a bitter and painful
			experience and a particularly harrowing one for her.
		</p>
		<p>
			Let us leave the story now for Umm Salamah herself to tell...
		</p>
		<p>
			When Abu Salamah (my husband) decided to leave for Madinah, he
			prepared a camel from me, hoisted me on it and placed our son
			Salamah on my lap. My husband then took the lead end went on
			without stopping or waiting for anything. Before we were out of
			Makkah however some men from my clan stopped us and said to my
			husband:
		</p>
		<p>
			"Though you are free to do what you like with yourself, you have
			no power over your wife. She is our daughter. Do you expect us to
			allow you to take her away from us?"
		</p>
		<p>
			They then pounced on him end snatched me away from him. My
			husbands clan, Banu Abdulasad, saw them taking both me and my
			child. They became hot with rage.
		</p>
		<p>
			"No! By Allah," they shouted, "we shall not abandon the boy. He
			is our son and we have a first claim over him."  They took him by
			the hand and pulled him away from me. Suddenly in the space of a
			few moments, I found myself alone and lonely. My husband headed
			for Madinah by himself and his clan had snatched my son away from
			me. My own clan, Banu Makhzum, overpowered me and forced me to
			stay with them.
		</p>
		<p>
			From the day when my husband and my son were separated from me, I
			went out at noon every day to that valley and sat in the spot
			where this tragedy occurred. I would recall those terrible
			moments and weep until night fell on me.
		</p>
		<p>
			I continued like this for a year or so until one day a man from
			the Banu Umayyah passed by and saw my condition. He went back to
			my clan and said:  "Why don't you free this poor woman? You have
			caused her husband and her son to be taken away from her."  He
			went on trying to soften their hearts and play on their emotions.
			At last they said to me. 'Go and join your husband if you wish."
		</p>
		<p>
			But how could I join my husband in Madinah and leave my son, a
			piece of my own flesh and blood, in Makkah among the Banu
			Abdulasad? How could I be free from anguish and my eyes be free
			from tears were I to reach the place of hijrah not knowing
			anything of my little son left behind in Makkah?
		</p>
		<p>
			Some realized what I was going through and their hearts went out
			to me. They petitioned the Banu Abdulasad on my behalf and moved
			them to return my son.	I did not now even want to linger in
			Makkah till I found someone to travel with me and I was afraid
			that something might happen that would delay or prevent me from
			reaching my husband. So I promptly got my camel ready, placed my
			son on my lap and left in the direction of Madinah .
		</p>
		<p>
			I had just about reached Tanim (about three miles from Makkah)
			when I met Uthman ibn Talhah. (He was a keeper of the Kabah in
			pre-lslamic times and was not yet a Muslim.)
		</p>
		<p>
			"Where are you going, Bint Zad ar-Rakib?" he asked.
		</p>
		<p>
			"I am going to my husband in Madinah."
		</p>
		<p>
			"And there isn't anyone with you?"
		</p>
		<p>
			"No, by Allah. Except Allah and my little boy here."
		</p>
		<p>
			"By Allah. I shall never abandon you until you reach Madinah," he
			vowed.
		</p>
		<p>
			He then took the reins of my camel and led us on. I have, by
			Allah, never met an Arab more generous and noble than he. When we
			reached a resting place, he would make my camel kneel down, wait
			until I dismounted, lead the camel to a tree and tether it. He
			would then go to the shade of another tree. When we had rested he
			would get the camel ready and lead us on.
		</p>
		<p>
			This he did every day until we reached Madinah. When we got to
			the village near Quba (about two miles from Madinah) belonging to
			Banu Amr ibn Awf, he said, "Your husband is in this village.
			Enter it with the blessings of God. "
		</p>
		<p>
			He turned back and headed for Makkah.  Their roads finally met
			after the long separation. Umm Salamah was overjoyed to see her
			husband and he was delighted to see his wife and son.
		</p>
		<p>
			Great and momentous events followed one after the other. There
			was the battle of Badr in which Abu Salamah fought. The Muslims
			returned victorious and strengthened. Then there was the battle
			of Uhud in which the Muslims were sorely tested. Abu Salamah came
			out of this wounded very badly. He appeared at first to respond
			well to treatment, but his wounds never healed completely and he
			remained bedridden.
		</p>
		<p>
			Once while Umm Salamah was nursing him, he said to her:  "I heard
			the Messenger of God saying. Whenever a calamity afflicts anyone
			he should say, "Surely from Allah we are and to Him we shall
			certainly return." And he would pray, 'O Lord, give me in return
			something good from it which only You Exalted and Mighty, can
			give."
		</p>
		<p>
			Abu Salamah remained sick in bed for several days. One morning
			the Prophet came to see him. The visit was longer than usual.
			While the Prophet was still at his bedside Abu Salamah passed
			away. With his blessed hands, the Prophet closed the eyes of his
			dead companion. He then raised these hands to the heavens and
			prayed:
		</p>
		<p>
			"O Lord, grant forgiveness to Abu Salamah. Elevate him among
			those who are near to You. Take charge of his family at all
			times. Forgive us and him, O Lord of the Worlds. Widen his grave
			and make it light for him."
		</p>
		<p>
			Umm Salamah remembered the prayer her husband had quoted on his
			deathbed from the Prophet and began repeating it, "O Lord, with
			you I leave this my plight for consideration . . ." But she could
			not bring herself to continue . . . "O Lord give me something
			good from it", because she kept asking herself, "Who could be
			better than Abu Salamah?" But it did not take long before she
			completed the supplication.
		</p>
		<p>
			The Muslims were greatly saddened by the plight of Umm Salamah.
			She became known as "Ayyin al-Arab"-- the one who had lost her
			husband. She had no one in Madinah of her own except her small
			children, like a hen without feathers.
		</p>
		<p>
			Both the Muhajirun and Ansar felt they had a duty to Umm Salamah.
			When she had completed the Iddah (three months and ten days), Abu
			Bakr proposed marriage to her but she refused. Then Umar asked to
			marry her but she also declined the proposal. The Prophet then
			approached her and she replied:
		</p>
		<p>
			"O Messenger of Allah, I have three characteristics. I am a woman
			who is extremely jealous and I am afraid that you will see in me
			something that will anger you and cause Allah to punish me. I am
			a woman who is already advanced in age and I am a woman who has a
			young family."
		</p>
		<p>
			The Prophet replied: "Regarding the jealousy you mentioned, I
			pray to Allah the Almighty to let it go away from you. Regarding
			the question of age you have mentioned. I am afflicted with the
			same problem as you. Regarding the dependent family you have
			mentioned, your family is my family."
		</p>
		<p>
			They were married and so it was that Allah answered the prayer of
			Umm Salamah and gave her better than Abu Salamah. From that day
			on Hind al Makhzumiyah was no longer the mother of Salamah alone
			but became the mother of all believers, Umm al-Mumineen.

	<biography name="Abdullah ibn Umm Maktum">
		<p>
			Abdullah ibn Umm Maktum was a cousin of Khadijah bint Khuwaylid,
			Mother of the Believers, may God be pleased with her. His father
			was Qays ibn Said and his mother was Aatikah bint Abdullah. She
			was called Umm Maktum (Mother of the Concealed One) because she
			gave birth to a blind child.
		</p>
		<p>
			Abdullah witnessed the rise of Islam in Makkah. He was amongst
			the first to accept Islam. He lived through the persecution of
			the Muslims and suffered what the other companions of the Prophet
			experienced. His attitude, like theirs, was one of firmness,
			staunch resistance and sacrifice. Neither his dedication nor his
			faith weakened against the violence of the Quraysh onslaught. In
			fact, all this only increased his determination to hold on to the
			religion of God and his devotion to His messenger.
		</p>
		<p>
			Abdullah was devoted to the noble Prophet and he was so eager to
			memorize the Quran that he would not miss any opportunity to
			achieve his hearts desire. Indeed, his sense of urgency and his
			insistence could sometimes have been irritating as he,
			unintentionally, sought to monopolize the attention of the
			Prophet.
		</p>
		<p>
			In this period, the Prophet, peace be upon him, was concentrating
			on the Quraysh notables and was eager that they should become
			Muslims. On one particular day, he met Utbah ibn Rabiah and his
			brother Shaybah, Amr ibn Hisham better known as Abu Jahl, Umayyah
			ibn Khalaf and Walid ibn Mughirah, the father of Khalid ibn Walid
			who was later to be known as Sayf Allah or 'the sword of God'. He
			had begun talking and negotiating with them and telling them
			about Islam. He so much wished that they would respond positively
			to him and accept Islam or at least call off their persecution of
			his companions.
		</p>
		<p>
			While he was thus engaged, Abdullah ibn Umm Maktum came up and
			asked him to read a verse from the Quran.  "O messenger of God,"
			he said, "teach me from what God has taught you."
		</p>
		<p>
			The Prophet frowned and turned away from him. He turned his
			attention instead to the prestigious group of Quraysh, hoping
			that they would become Muslims and that by their acceptance of
			Islam they would bring greatness to the religion of God and
			strengthen his mission. As soon as he had finished speaking to
			them and had left their company. he suddenly felt partially
			blinded and his head began to throb violently. At this point the
			following revelation came to him:
		</p>
		<p>
			"He frowned and turned away when the blind man approached him !
			Yet for all you knew, (O Muhammad), he might perhaps have grown
			in purity or have been reminded of the Truth, and helped by this
			reminder. Now as for him who believes himself to be
			self-sufficient, to him you gave your whole attention, although
			you are not accountable for his failure to attain to purity. But
			as for him who came unto you full of eagerness and in awe of God,
			him did you disregard.
		</p>
		<p>
			Nay, verily, this is but a reminder and so, whoever is willing
			may remember Him in the light of His revelations blest with
			dignity, lofty and pure, borne by the hands of messengers, noble
			and most virtuous.' (Surah Abasa 8O: 116).
		</p>
		<p>
			These are the sixteen verses which were revealed to the noble
			Prophet about Abdullah ibn Umm Maktum, sixteen verses that have
			continued to be recited from that time till today and shall
			continue to be recited.
		</p>
		<p>
			From that day the Prophet did not cease to be generous to
			Abdullah ibn Umm Maktum. to ask him about his affairs, to fulfill
			his needs and take him into his council whenever he approached.
			This is not strange. Was he not censured by God in a most severe
			manner on Abdullah's account? In fact, in later years, he often
			greeted Ibn Umm Maktum with these words of humility:
		</p>
		<p>
			"Welcome unto him on whose account my Sustainer has rebuked me." 
			When the Quraysh intensified their persecution of the Prophet and
			those who believed with him, God gave them permission to
			emigrate. Abdullahs response was prompt. He and Musab ibn Umayr
			were the first of the Companions to reach Madinah.
		</p>
		<p>
			As soon as they reached Yathrib, he and Musab began discussing
			with the people, reading the Quran to them and teaching them the
			religion of God. When the Prophet, upon whom be peace, arrived in
			Madinah, he appointed Abdullah and Bilal ibn Rabah to be
			muadh-dhins for the Muslims, proclaiming the Oneness of God five
			times a day, calling man to the best of actions and summoning
			them to success .
		</p>
		<p>
			Bilal would call the adhan and Abdullah would pronounce the
			iqamah for the Prayer. Sometimes they would reverse the process.
			During Ramadan, they adopted a special routine. One of them would
			call the adhan to wake people up to eat before the fast began.
			The other would call the adhan to announce the beginning of dawn
			and the fast. It was Bilal who would awaken the people and
			Abdullah ibn Umm Maktum who would announce the beginning of dawn.
		</p>
		<p>
			One of the responsibilities that the Prophet placed on Abdullah
			ibn Umm Maktum was to put him in charge of Madinah in his
			absence. This was done more than ten times, one of them being
			when he left for the liberation of Makkah.
		</p>
		<p>
			Soon after the battle of Badr, the Prophet received a revelation
			from God raising the status of the mujahideen and preferring them
			over the qaideen (those who remain inactive at home). This was in
			order to encourage the mujahid even further and to spur the qaid
			to give up his inactivity. This revelation affected ibn Umm
			Maktum deeply. It pained him to be thus barred from the higher
			status and he said:
		</p>
		<p>
			O messenger of God. If I could go on jihad, I would certainly
			do." He then earnestly asked God to send down a revelation about
			his particular case and those like him who were prevented because
			of their disabilities from going on military campaigns.
		</p>
		<p>
			His prayer was answered. An additional phrase was revealed to the
			Prophet exempting those with disabilities from the import of the
			original verse. The full ayah became:
		</p>
		<p>
			"Not equal are those who remain seated among the believers,
			except those who possess disabilities, and those who strive and
			fight in the way of God with their wealth and their persons . .
			." (Surah an-Nisaa, 4: 95).
		</p>
		<p>
			In spite of thus being excused from jihad, the soul of Abdullah
			ibn Umm Maktum refused to be content with staying among those who
			remained at home when an expedition was in progress. Great souls
			are not content with remaining detached from affairs of great
			moment. He determined that no campaign should by-pass him. He
			fixed a role for himself on the battle field. He would say:
			"Place me between two rows and give me the standard. I will carry
			it for you and protect it, for I am blind and cannot run away. "
		</p>
		<p>
			In the fourteenth year after the hijrah, Umar resolved to mount a
			major assault against the Persians to bring down their State and
			open the way for the Muslim forces. So he wrote to his governors:
		</p>
		<p>
			"Send anyone with a weapon or a horse or who can offer any form
			of help to me. And make haste."
		</p>
		<p>
			Crowds of Muslims from every direction responded to Umar's call
			and converged on Madinah. Among all these was the blind mujahid
			Abdullah ibn Umm Maktum.  Umar appointed Saud ibn Abi Waqqas
			commander over the army, gave him instructions and bade him
			farewell. When the army reached Qadisiyyah, Abdullah ibn Umm
			Maktum was prominent, wearing a coat of armor and fully prepared.
			He had vowed to carry and protect the standard of the Muslims or
			be killed in the process.
		</p>
		<p>
			The forces met and engaged in battle for three days. The fighting
			was among the most fierce and bitter in the history of the Muslim
			conquests. On the third day, the Muslims achieved a mighty
			victory as one of the greatest empires in the world collapsed and
			one of the most secure thrones fell. The standard of Tawhid was
			raised in an idolatrous land. The price of this clear victory was
			hundreds of martyrs. Among them was Abdullah ibn Umm Maktum. He
			was found dead on the battlefield clutching the flag of the
			Muslims.

	<biography name="Umayr ibn Wahb">
		<p>
			Umayr ibn Wahb al-Jumahi returned safely from the Battle of Badr.
			His son, Wahb, was left behind, a prisoner in the hands of the
			Muslims. Umar feared that the Muslims would punish the youth
			severely because of the persecution he himself had meted out to
			the Prophet and the torture he had inflicted on his companions.
		</p>
		<p>
			One morning Umayr went to the Sacred Mosque to make tawaf around
			the Kabah and worship his idols. He found Safwan ibn Umayyah
			sitting near the Kabah, went up to him and said:
		</p>
		<p>
			Im Sabahan (Good Morning), Quraysh chieftain."
		</p>
		<p>
			"Im Sabahan, Ibn Wahb," replied Safwan. "Let us talk for some
			time. Time only goes by with conversation."
		</p>
		<p>
			Umayr sat next to him. The two men began to recall Badr, the
			great defeat they had suffered and they counted the prisoners who
			had fallen into the hands of Muhammad and his companions. They
			became deeply distressed at the number of great Quraysh men who
			had been killed by the swords of the Muslims and who lay buried
			in the mass grave at al-Qalib in Badr.
		</p>
		<p>
			Safwan ibn Umayyah shook his head and sighed, "By God, there can
			be no better after them."
		</p>
		<p>
			"You are right," declared Umar. He remained silent for a while
			and then said, "By the God of the Kabah, if I had no debts and no
			family whose loss I fear after me, I would go to Muhammad and
			kill him, finish off his mission and check his evil." He went on
			in a faint, subdued voice, "And as my son Wahb is among them, my
			going to Yathrib would be beyond doubt."
		</p>
		<p>
			Safwan ibn Umayyah listened intently to the words of Umayr and
			did not wish this opportunity to pass. He turned to him and said:
		</p>
		<p>
			"Umar, place all your debt in my hands and I will discharge it
			for you whatever the amount. As for your family, I shall take
			them as my own family and give them whatever they need. I have
			enough wealth to guarantee them a comfortable living."
		</p>
		<p>
			"Agreed," said Umar. "But keep this conversation of ours secret
			and do not divulge any of it to anyone."
		</p>
		<p>
			"That shall be so," said Safwan.
		</p>
		<p>
			Umar left the Masjid al-Haram with the fire of hatred against
			Muhammad blazing in his heart. He began to count what he needed
			for the task he had set himself. He knew that he had the full
			support and confidence of the Quraysh who had members of their
			families held prisoner in Madinah .
		</p>
		<p>
			Umar had his sword sharpened and coated with poison. His camel
			was prepared and brought to him. He mounted the beast and rode in
			the direction of Madinah with evil in his heart.
		</p>
		<p>
			Umar reached Madinah and went directly towards the mosque looking
			for the Prophet. Near the door of the mosque, he alighted and
			tethered his camel.
		</p>
		<p>
			At that time, Umar was sitting with some of the Sahabah near the
			door of the Mosque, reminiscing about Badr, the number of
			prisoners that had been taken and the number of Quraysh killed.
			They also recalled the acts of heroism shown by the Muslims, both
			the Muhajirun and the Ansar and gave thanks to God for the great
			victory He had given them.
		</p>
		<p>
			At that very moment Umar turned around and saw Umayr ibn Wahb
			alighting from his camel and going towards the Mosque brandishing
			his sword.  Alarmed, he jumped up and shouted. "This is the dog,
			the enemy of God, Umayr ibn Wahb. By God, he has only come to do
			evil. He led the Mushrikeen against us in Makkah and he was a spy
			for them against us shortly before Badr. Go to the Messenger of
			God, stand around him and warn him that this dirty traitor is
			after him."
		</p>
		<p>
			Umar himself hastened to the Prophet and said, "O Rasulullah,
			this enemy of God, Umayr ibn Wahb, has come brandishing his sword
			and I think that he could only be up to something evil."  "Let
			him come in," said the Prophet.
		</p>
		<p>
			Umar approached Umayr, took hold of him by the tails of his
			robes, pressed the back of his sword against his neck and took
			him to the Prophet.
		</p>
		<p>
			When the Prophet saw Umayr in this condition he said to Umar:
			"Release him.' He then turned to Umayr and said: "Come closer."
			Umayr came closer and said, "Im Sabaha" (the Arab greeting in the
			days of Jahiliyyah)."
		</p>
		<p>
			"God has granted us a greeting better than this, Umayr," said the
			Prophet. "God has granted us the greeting of Peace--it is the
			greeting of the people of Paradise."  "What have you come for?"
			continued the Prophet.
		</p>
		<p>
			"I came here hoping to have the prisoner in your hands released,
			so please oblige me."  "And what is this sword around your neck
			for?" quizzed the Prophet.  "Tell me the truth. What have you
			come for, Umayr?" prodded the Prophet.	"I have only come to have
			the prisoner released," insisted Umar.
		</p>
		<p>
			"No. You and Safwan ibn Umayyah sat near the Kabah recalling your
			companions who lie buried at al-Qalib and then you said, 'If I
			had no debt or no family to look after, I would certainly go out
			to kill Muhammad.' Safwan took over your debt and promised to
			look after your family in return for your agreeing to kill me.
			But God is a barrier between you and your achieving your aim."
		</p>
		<p>
			Umar stood stupefied nor a moment, then said:  "I bear witness
			that you are the messenger of God."  "We used, O messenger of'
			God." he continued, "to reject whatever good you had brought and
			whatever revelation came to you. But my conversation with Safwan
			ibn Umayyah was not known to anyone else. By God, I am certain
			that only God could have made this known to you. Praise be to God
			Who has led me to you that He may guide me to Islam.' He then
			testified that there is no god but Allah and that Muhammad is the
			messenger of Allah and became a Muslim. Thereupon, the Prophet
			instructed his companions: "instruct your brother in his
			religion. Teach him the Quran and set free his prisoner."
		</p>
		<p>
			The Muslims were extremely happy with Umayr's acceptance of
			Islam. Even Umar who once said of him, "A pig is certainly dearer
			to me than Umayr ibn Wahb" came up to the Prophet and exclaimed
			"Today, he is dearer to me than some of my own children."
		</p>
		<p>
			Thereafter Umayr spent much time increasing his knowledge of
			Islam and filling his heart with the light of the Quran. There,
			in Madinah, he spent the sweetest and richest days of his life
			away from what he had known in Makkah .
		</p>
		<p>
			Back in Makkah, Safwan was filled with hope and would say to the
			Quraysh, "I will soon give you some great news that would make
			you forget the events of Badr."  Safwan waited for a long time
			and then gradually became more and more anxious. Greatly
			agitated, he would go out and ask travelers what news they had of
			Umayr ibn Wahb but no one was able to give him a satisfactory
			reply. Eventually a rider came and said "Umar has become a
			Muslim."
		</p>
		<p>
			The news hit Safwan like a thunderbolt. He was certain that Umayr
			would never become a Muslim and if he ever did then everyone on
			the face of the earth would become Muslim also. "Never shall I
			speak to him and never shall I do anything for him," he said.
		</p>
		<p>
			Umar meanwhile kept on striving to gain a good understanding of
			his religion and memorize whatever he could of the words of God.
			When he felt he had achieved a certain degree of confidence, he
			went to the Prophet and said:
		</p>
		<p>
			"O Rasulullah, much time has passed since I used to try to put
			out the light of God and severely tortured whoever was on the
			path of Islam. Now, I desire that you should give me permission
			to go to Makkah and invite the Quraysh to God and His Messenger.
			If they accept it from me, that will be good. And if they oppose
			me, I shall harass them as I used to harass the companions of the
			Prophet."
		</p>
		<p>
			The Prophet gave his consent and Umayr left for Makkah. He went
			straight to the house of Safwan ibn Umayyah and said: "Safwan,
			you are one of the chieftains of Makkah and one of the most
			intelligent of the Quraysh. Do you really think that these stones
			you are worship ping and making sacrifice to, deserve to be the
			basis of a religion? As for myself, I declare that there is no
			god but Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah." At
			Umayr's hands, many Makkans became Muslims, but Safwan did not.
		</p>
		<p>
			Later, during the liberation of Makkah, Safwan ibn Umayyah
			attempted to flee from the Muslim forces. Umar, however, obtained
			an amnesty from the Prophet for him and he too became a Muslim
			and distinguished himself in the service of Islam.

		<p>
			Khalid ibn Zayd ibn Kulayb from the Banu Najjar was a great and
			close companion of the Prophet. He was known as Abu Ayyub (the
			father of Ayyub) and enjoyed a privilege which many of the Ansar
			in Madinah hoped they would have.
		</p>
		<p>
			When the Prophet, peace and blessings of God be on him, reached
			Madinah after his hijrah from Makkah, he was greeted with great
			enthusiasm by the Ansar of Madinah. Their hearts went out to him
			and their eyes followed him with devotion and love. They wanted
			to give him the most generous reception anyone could be given.
		</p>
		<p>
			The Prophet first stopped at Quba on the outskirts of Madinah and
			stayed there for some days. The first thing he did was to build a
			mosque which is described in the Quran as the "mosque built on
			the foundation of piety (taqwa)". (Surah At-Tawhah 9: 1O8).
		</p>
		<p>
			The Prophet entered Madinah on his camel. The chieftains of the
			city stood along his path, each one wishing to have the honor of
			the Prophet alighting and staying at his house. One after the
			other stood in the camel's way entreating, "Stay with us, O
			Rasulullah."  "Leave the camel," the Prophet would say. "It is
			under command. "
		</p>
		<p>
			The camel continued walking, closely followed by the eyes and
			hearts of the people of Yathrib. When it went past a house, its
			owner would feel sad and dejected and hope would rise in the
			hearts of others still on the route.

			The camel continued in this fashion with the people following it
			until it hesitated at an open space in front of the house of Abu
			Ayyub al-Ansari. But the Prophet, upon whom be peace, did not get
			down. After only a short while, the camel set off again, the
			Prophet leaving its reins loose. Before long, however, it turned
			round, retraced its steps and stopped on the same spot as before.
			Abu Ayyub's heart was filled with happiness. He went out to the
			Prophet and greeted him with great enthusiasm. He took the
			Prophet's baggage in his arms and felt as if he was carrying the
			most precious treasure in the world.
		</p>
		<p>
			Abu Ayyub's house had two stories. He emptied the upper floor of
			his and his family's possessions so that the Prophet could stay
			there. But the Prophet, peace be on him, preferred to stay on the
			lower floor.
		</p>
		<p>
			Night came and the Prophet retired. Abu Ayyub went up to the
			upper floor. But when they had closed the door, Abu Ayyub turned
			to his wife and said:
		</p>
		<p>
			"Woe to us! What have we done? The messenger of God is below and
			we are higher than he! Can we walk on top of the messenger of
			God? Do we come between him and the Revelation (Wahy)? If so, we
			are doomed."
		</p>
		<p>
			The couple became very worried not knowing what to do. They only
			got some peace of mind when they moved to the side of the
			building which did not fall directly above the Prophet. They were
			careful also only to walk on the outer parts of the floor and
			avoid the middle.
		</p>
		<p>
			In the morning, Abu Ayyub said to the Prophet:	"By God, we did
			not sleep a wink last night, neither myself nor Umm Ayyub."  "Why
			not, Abu Ayyub?" asked the Prophet.  Abu Ayyub explained how
			terrible they felt being above while the Prophet was below them
			and how they might have interrupted the Revelation.  "Don't
			worry, Abu Ayyub," said the Prophet. "We prefer the lower floor
			because of the many people coming to visit us."  "We submitted to
			the Prophet's wishes," Abu Ayyub related, "until one cold night a
			jar of ours broke and the water spilled on the upper floor. Umm
			Ayyub and I stared at the water We only had one piece of velvet
			which we used as a blanket. We used it to mop up the water out of
			fear that it would seep through to the Prophet. In the morning I
			went to him and said, 'I do not like to be above you,' and told
			him what had happened. He accepted my wish and we changed
			floors."
		</p>
		<p>
			The Prophet stayed in Abu Ayyub's house for almost seven months
			until his mosque was completed on the open space where his camel
			had stopped. He moved to the roots which were built around the
			mosque for himself and his family. He thus became a neighbor of
			Abu Ayyub. What noble neighbor to have had!
		</p>
		<p>
			Abu Ayyub continued to love the Prophet with all his heart end
			the Prophet also loved him dearly. There was no formality between
			them. The Prophet continued to regard Abu Ayyub's house as his
			own. The following anecdote tells a great deal about the
			relationship between them.
		</p>
		<p>
			Abu Bakr, may God be pleased with him, once left his house in the
			burning heat of the midday sun and went to the mosque. Umar saw
			him and asked, "Abu Bakr, what has brought you out at this hour?
			Abu Bakr said he had left his house because he was terribly
			hungry and Umar said that he had left his house for the same
			reason. The Prophet came up to them and asked, "What has brought
			the two of you out at this hour?" They told him and he said, "By
			Him in Whose hands is my soul, only hunger has caused me to come
			out also. But come with me."
		</p>
		<p>
			They went to the house of Abu Ayyub al-Ansari. His wife opened
			the door and said, "Welcome to the Prophet and whoever is with
			him."
		</p>
		<p>
			"Where is Abu Ayyub?" asked the Prophet. Abu Ayyub, who was
			working in a nearby palm grove, heard the Prophet's voice and
			came hurriedly.
		</p>
		<p>
			"Welcome to the Prophet and whoever is with him," he said and
			went on "O Prophet of God, this is not the time that you usually
			come." (Abu Ayyub used to keep some food for the Prophet every
			day. When the Prophet did not come for it by a certain time, Abu
			Ayyub would give it to his family.)  "You are right," the Prophet
			agreed.
		</p>
		<p>
			Abu Ayyub went out and cut a cluster of dates in which there were
			ripe and halfripe dates. "I did not want you to eat this," said
			the Prophet. "Could you not have brought only the ripe dates?" 
			"O Rasulullah, please eat from both the ripe dates (rutb) and the
			half ripe (busr). I shall slaughter an animal for you also. " 
			"If you are going to, then do not kill one that gives milk,"
			cautioned the Prophet.	Abu Ayyub killed a young goat, cooked
			half and grilled the other half. He also asked his wife to bake,
			because she baked better he said.
		</p>
		<p>
			When the food was ready, it was placed before the Prophet and his
			two companions. The Prophet took a piece of meat and placed it in
			a loaf and said, "Abu Ayyub, take this to Fatima. She has not
			tasted the like of this for days.
		</p>
		<p>
			When they had eaten and were satisfied, the Prophet said
			reflectively: "Bread and meat and busr and rutb!" Tears began to
			flow from his eyes as he continued:
		</p>
		<p>
			"This is a bountiful blessing about which you will be asked on
			the Day of judgment. If such comes your way, put your hands to it
			and say, Bismillah (In the name of God) and when you have
			finished say, Al hamdu lillah alladhee huwa ashbana wa anama
			alayna (Praise be to God Who has given us enough and Who has
			bestowed his bounty on us). This is best."
		</p>
		<p>
			These are glimpses of Abu Ayyub's live during peace time. He also
			had a distinguished military career. Much of his time was spent
			as a warrior until it was said of him, "He did not stay away from
			any battle the Muslims fought from the time of the Prophet to the
			time of Muawiyah unless he was engaged at the same time in
			another."
		</p>
		<p>
			The last campaign he took part in was the one prepared by
			Muawiyah and led by his son Yazid against Constantinople. Abu
			Ayyub at that time was a very old man, almost eighty years old.
			But that did not prevent him from joining the army and crossing
			the seas as a ghazi in the path of God. After only a short time
			engaged in the battle, Abu Ayyub fell ill and had to withdraw
			from fighting. Yazid came to him and asked:
		</p>
		<p>
			"Do you need anything, Abu Ayyub?"  "Convey my salaams to the
			Muslim armies and say to them: "Abu Ayyub urges you to penetrate
			deeply into the territory of the enemy as far as you can go, that
			you should carry him with you and that you should bury him under
			your feet at the walls of Constantinople." Then he breathed his
			last.
		</p>
		<p>
			The Muslim army fulfilled the desire of the companion of the
			Messenger of God. They pushed back the enemy's forces in attack
			after attack until they reached the walls of Constantinople.
			There they buried him.
		</p>
		<p>
			(The Muslims beseiged the city for four years but eventually had
			to withdraw after suffering heavy losses.)

	<biography name="Salman al-Farsi">
		<p>
			This is a story of a seeker of Truth, the story of Salman the
			Persian, gleaned, to begin with, from his own words:
		</p>
		<p>
			I grew up in the town of Isfahan in Persia in the village of
			Jayyan. My father was the Dihqan or chief of the village. He was
			the richest person there and had the biggest house.
		</p>
		<p>
			Since I was a child my father loved me, more than he loved any
			other. As time went by his love for me became so strong and
			overpowering that he feared to lose me or have anything happen to
			me. So he kept me at home, a veritable prisoner, in the same way
			that young girls were kept.
		</p>
		<p>
			I became devoted to the Magian religion so much so that I
			attained the position of custodian of the fire which we
			worshipped. My duty was to see that the flames of the fire
			remained burning and that it did not go out for a single hour,
			day or night.
		</p>
		<p>
			My father had a vast estate which yielded an abundant supply of
			crops. He himself looked after the estate and the harvest. One
			day he was very busy with his duties as dihqan in the village and
			he said to me:
		</p>
		<p>
			"My son, as you see, I am too busy to go out to the estate now.
			Go and look after matters there for me today."
		</p>
		<p>
			On my way to the estate, I passed a Christian church and the
			voices at prayer attracted my attention. I did not know anything
			about Christianity or about the followers of any other religion
			throughout the time my father kept me in the house away from
			people. When I heard the voices of the Christians I entered the
			church to see what they were doing.  I was impressed by their
			manner of praying and felt drawn to their religion. "By God," I
			said, "this is better than ours. I shall not leave them until the
			sun sets."
		</p>
		<p>
			I asked and was told that the Christian religion originated in
			Ash-Sham (Greater Syria). I did not go to my father's estate that
			day and at night, I returned home. My father met me and asked
			what I had done. I told him about my meeting with the Christians
			and how I was impressed by their religion. He was dismayed and
			said:
		</p>
		<p>
			"My son, there is nothing good in that religion. Your religion
			and the religion of your forefathers is better."
		</p>
		<p>
			"No, their religion is better than ours," I insisted.
		</p>
		<p>
			My father became upset and afraid that I would leave our
			religion. So he kept me locked up in the house and put a chain on
			my feet. I managed however to send a message to the Christians
			asking them to inform me of any caravan going to Syria. Before
			long they got in touch with me and told me that a caravan was
			headed for Syria. I managed to unfetter myself and in disguise
			accompanied the caravan to Syria. There, I asked who was the
			leading person in the Christian religion and was directed to the
			bishop of the church. I went up to him and said:
		</p>
		<p>
			"I want to become a Christian and would like to attach myself to
			your service, learn from you and pray with you."
		</p>
		<p>
			The bishop agreed and I entered the church in his service. I soon
			found out, however, that the man was corrupt. He would order his
			followers to give money in charity while holding out the promise
			of blessings to them. When they gave anything to spend in the way
			of God, however, he would hoard it for himself and not give
			anything to the poor or needy. In this way he amassed a vast
			quantity of gold. When the bishop died and the Christians
			gathered to bury him, I told them of his corrupt practices and,
			at their request, showed them where he kept their donations. When
			they saw the large jars filled with gold and silver they said.
		</p>
		<p>
			"By God, we shall not bury him." They nailed him on a cross and
			threw stones at him.  I continued in the service of the person
			who replaced him. The new bishop was an ascetic who longed for
			the Hereafter and engaged in worship day and night. I was greatly
			devoted to him and spent a long time in his company.
		</p>
		<p>
			(After his death, Salman attached himself to various Christian
			religious figures, in Mosul, Nisibis and elsewhere. The last one
			had told him about the appearance of a Prophet in the land of the
			Arabs who would have a reputation for strict honesty, one who
			would accept a gift but would never consume charity (sadaqah) for
			himself. Salman continues his story.)
		</p>
		<p>
			A group of Arab leaders from the Kalb tribe passed through
			Ammuriyah and I asked them to take me with them to the land of
			the Arabs in return for whatever money I had. They agreed and I
			paid them. When we reached Wadi al-Qura (a place between Madinah
			and Syria), they broke their agreement and sold me to a Jew. I
			worked as a servant for him but eventually he sold me to a nephew
			of his belonging to the tribe of Banu Qurayzah. This nephew took
			me with him to Yathrib, the city of palm groves, which is how the
			Christian at Ammuriyah had described it.
		</p>
		<p>
			At that time the Prophet was inviting his people in Makkah to
			Islam but I did not hear anything about him then because of the
			harsh duties which slavery imposed upon me.
		</p>
		<p>
			When the Prophet reached Yathrib after his hijrah from Makkah, I
			was in fact at the top of a palm tree belonging to my master
			doing some work. My master was sitting under the tree. A nephew
			of his came up and said:
		</p>
		<p>
			"May God declare war on the Aws and the Khazraj (the two main
			Arab tribes of Yathrib). By God, they are now gathering at Quba
			to meet a man who has today come from Makkah and who claims he is
			a Prophet."
		</p>
		<p>
			I felt hot flushes as soon as I heard these words and I began to
			shiver so violently that I was afraid that I might fall on my
			master. I quickly got down from the tree and spoke to my master's
			nephew.
		</p>
		<p>
			"What did you say? Repeat the news for me."
		</p>
		<p>
			My master was very angry and gave me a terrible blow. "What does
			this matter to you'? Go back to what you were doing," he shouted.
		</p>
		<p>
			That evening, I took some dates that I had gathered and went to
			the place where the Prophet had alighted. I went up to him and
			said:
		</p>
		<p>
			"I have heard that you are a righteous man and that you have
			companions with you who are strangers and are in need. Here is
			something from me as sadaqah. I see that you are more deserving
			of it than others."
		</p>
		<p>
			The Prophet ordered his companions to eat but he himself did not
			eat of it.  I gathered some more dates and when the Prophet left
			Quba for Madinah I went to him and said: "I noticed that you did
			not eat of the sadaqah I gave. This however is a gift for you."
			Of this gift of dates, both he and his companions ate.
		</p>
		<p>
			The strict honesty of the Prophet was one of the characteristics
			that led Salman to believe in him and accept Islam .
		</p>
		<p>
			Salman was released from slavery by the Prophet who paid his
			Jewish slave-owner a stipulated price and who himself planted an
			agreed number of date palms to secure his manumission. After
			accepting Islam, Salman would say when asked whose son he was:
		</p>
		<p>
			"I am Salman, the son of Islam from the children of Adam."
		</p>
		<p>
			Salman was to play an important role in the struggles of the
			growing Muslim state. At the battle of Khandaq, he proved to be
			an innovator in military strategy. He suggested digging a ditch
			or khandaq around Madinah to keep the Quraysh army at bay. When
			Abu Sufyan, the leader of the Makkans, saw the ditch, he said,
			"This stratagem has not been employed by the Arabs before."
		</p>
		<p>
			Salman became known as "Salman the Good". He was a scholar who
			lived a rough and ascetic life. He had one cloak which he wore
			and on which he slept. He would not seek the shelter of a roof
			but stayed under a tree or against a wall. A man once said to
			him:
		</p>
		<p>
			"Shall I not build you a house in which to live?"  "I have no
			need of a house," he replied.  The man persisted and said, "I
			know the type of house that would suit you."  "Describe it to
			me," said Salman.  "I shall build you a house which if you stand
			up in it, its roof will hurt your head and if you stretch your
			legs the wall will hurt them."
		</p>
		<p>
			Later, as a governor of al-Madain (Ctesiphon) near Baghdad,
			Salman received a stipend of five thousand dirhams. This he would
			distribute as sadaqah. He lived from the work of his own hands.
			When some people came to Madain and saw him working in the palm
			groves, they said, "You are the amir here and your sustenance is
			guaranteed and you do this work!"
		</p>
		<p>
			"I like to eat from the work of my own hands," he replied. Salman
			however was not extreme in his asceticism. It is related that he
			once visited Abu ad-Dardaa with whom the Prophet had joined him
			in brotherhood. He found Abu ad-Dardaas wife in a miserable state
			and he asked, "What is the matter with you."
		</p>
		<p>
			"Your brother has no need of anything in this world," she
			replied.
		</p>
		<p>
			When Abu ad-Dardaa came, he welcomed Salman and gave him food.
			Salman told him to eat but Abu ad-Dardaa said, "I am fasting."
		</p>
		<p>
			"I swear to you that I shall not eat until you eat also."
		</p>
		<p>
			Salman spent the night there as well. During the night, Abu
			ad-Dardaa got up but Salman got hold of him and said:
		</p>
		<p>
			"O Abu ad-Dardaa, your Lord has a right over you. Your family has
			a right over you and your body has a right over you. Give to each
			its due."
		</p>
		<p>
			In the morning, they prayed together and then went out to meet
			the Prophet, peace be upon him. The Prophet supported Salman in
			what he had said.
		</p>
		<p>
			As a scholar, Salman was noted for his vast knowledge and wisdom.
			Ali said of him that he was like Luqman the Wise. And Kab
			al-Ahbar said: "Salman is stuffed with knowledge and wisdom--an
			ocean that does not dry up." Salman had a knowledge of both the
			Christian scriptures and the Quran in addition to his earlier
			knowledge of the Zoroastrian religion. Salman in fact translated
			parts of the Quran into Persian during the life-time of the
			Prophet. He was thus the first person to translate the Quran into
			a foreign language.
		</p>
		<p>
			Salman, because of the influential household in which he grew up,
			might easily have been a major figure in the sprawling Persian
			Empire of his time. His search for truth however led him, even
			before the Prophet had appeared, to renounce a comfortable and
			affluent life and even to suffer the indignities of slavery.
			According to the most reliable account, he died in the year
			thirty five after the hijrah, during the caliphate of Uthman, at
			Ctesiphon.

	<biography name="Amr ibn al-Jamuh">
		<p>
			Amr ibn al-Jamuh was one of the leading men in Yathrib in the
			days of Jahiliyyah. He was the chief of the Banu Salamah and was
			known to be one of the most generous and valiant persons in the
			city.
		</p>
		<p>
			One of the privileges of the city's leaders was having an idol to
			himself in his house. It was hoped that this idol would bless the
			leader in whatever he did. He was expected to offer sacrifices to
			it on special occasions and seek its help at times of distress.
			The idol of Amr was called Manat. He had made it from the most
			priceless wood. He spent a great deal of time, money and
			attention looking after it and he anointed it with the most
			exquisite perfumes.
		</p>
		<p>
			Amr was almost sixty years old when the first rays of the light
			of Islam began to penetrate the houses of Yathrib. House after
			house was introduced to the new faith at the hands of Musab ibn
			Umayr, the first missionary sent out to Yathrib before the
			hijrah. It was through him that Amr's three sons--Muawwadh, Muadh
			and Khallad--became Muslims. One of their contemporaries was the
			famous Muadh ibn Jabal. Amr's wife, Hind, also accepted Islam
			with her three sons but Amr himself knew nothing of all this .
		</p>
		<p>
			Hind saw that the people of Yathrib were being won over to Islam
			and that not one of the leaders of the city remained in shirk
			except her husband and a few individuals. She loved her husband
			dearly and was proud of him but she was concerned that he should
			die in a state of kufr and end up in hell-fire.
		</p>
		<p>
			During this time, Amr himself began to tell uneasy. He was afraid
			that his sons would give up the religion of their forefathers and
			follow the teaching of Musab ibn Umayr who, within a short space
			of time, had caused many to turn away from idolatry and enter the
			religion of Muhammad. To his wife, Amr therefore said:
		</p>
		<p>
			"Be careful that your children do not come into contact with this
			man (meaning Musab ibn Umayr) before we pronounce an opinion on
			him."
		</p>
		<p>
			"To hear is to obey," she replied. "But would you like to hear
			from your son Muadh what he relates from this man?"  "Woe to you!
			Has Muadh turned away from his religion without my knowing?"  The
			good woman felt pity from the old man and said:  "Not at all. But
			he has attended some of the meetings of this missionary and
			memorized some of the things he teaches."  "Tell him to come
			here," he said. When Muadh come, he ordered:  "Let me hear an
			example of what this man preaches." Muadh recited the lalihah
			(the Opening Chapter of the Quran):
		</p>
		<p>
			"In the name of God, the most Gracious, the Dispenser of Grace.
			All praise is due to God alone, the Sustainer of all the worlds,
			The most Gracious, the Dispenser of Grace. Lord of the Day of
			Judgment!
		</p>
		<p>
			You alone do we worship and to You alone do we turn for help. 
			Guide us on the straight way, the way of those upon whom you have
			bestowed Your blessings, not of those who have been condemned by
			You, nor of those who go astray."
		</p>
		<p>
			"How perfect are these words, and how beautiful!" exclaimed the
			father. "Is everything he says like this?"
		</p>
		<p>
			"Yes indeed, father. Do you wish to swear allegiance to him? All
			your people have already done so" urged Muadh.
		</p>
		<p>
			The old man remained silent from a while and then said, "I shall
			not do so until I consult Manat and see what he says."	"What
			indeed would Manat say, Father? It is only a piece of wood. It
			can neither think nor speak."  The old man retorted sharply, "I
			told you, I shall not do anything without him."
		</p>
		<p>
			Later that day, Amr went before Manat. It was the custom of the
			idolators then to place an old woman behind the idol when they
			wished to speak to it. She would reply on behalf of the idol,
			articulating, so they thought, what the idol had inspired her to
			say. Amr stood before the idol in great awe and addressed profuse
			praises to it. Then he said:
		</p>
		<p>
			"O Manat no doubt you know that this propagandist who was
			delegated to come to us from Makkah does not wish evil on anyone
			but you. He has come only to stop us worshipping you. I do not
			want to swear allegiance to him in spite of the beautiful words I
			have heard from him. I have thus come to get your advice. So
			please advise me."
		</p>
		<p>
			There was no reply from Manat. Amr continued:
		</p>
		<p>
			"Perhaps your are angry. But up till now, I have done nothing to
			harm you... Never mind, I shall leave you for a few days to let
			your anger go away."
		</p>
		<p>
			Amr's sons knew the extent of their father's dependence on Manat
			and how with time he had become almost a part of it. They
			realized however that the idol's place in his heart was being
			shaken and that they had to help him get rid of Manat. That must
			be his path to faith in God.
		</p>
		<p>
			One night Amr's sons went with their friend Muadh ibn Jabal to
			Manat, took the idol From its place and threw it in a cess pit
			belonging to the Banu Salamah. They returned to their homes with
			no one knowing anything about what they had done. When Amr woke
			up the following morning, he went in quiet reverence to pay his
			respects to his idol but did not find it.
		</p>
		<p>
			"Woe to you all," he shouted. "Who has attacked our god last
			night"	There was no reply from anyone. He began to search for
			the idol, fuming with rage and threatening the perpetrators of
			the crime. Eventually he found the idol turned upside down on its
			head in the pit. He washed and perfumed it and returned it to its
			usual place saying.
		</p>
		<p>
			"If I find out who did this to you, I will humiliate him."  The
			following night the boys did the same to the idol. The old man
			recovered it, washed and perfumed it as he had done before and
			returned it to its place. This happened several times until one
			night Amr put a sword around the idol's neck and said to it:  "O
			Manat, I don't know who is doing this to you. If you have any
			power of good in you, defend yourself against this evil. Here is
			a sword for you."
		</p>
		<p>
			The youths waited until Amr was fast asleep. They took the sword
			from the idol's neck and threw it into the pit. Amr found the
			idol Lying face down in the pit with the sword nowhere in sight.
			At last he was convinced that the idol had no power at all and
			did not deserve to be worshipped. It was not long before he
			entered the religion of Islam.
		</p>
		<p>
			Amr soon tasted the sweetness of Iman or faith in the One True
			God. At the same time he felt great pain and anguish within
			himself at the thought of every moment he had spent in shirk. His
			acceptance of the new religion was total and he placed himself,
			his wealth and his children in the service of God and His
			Prophet.
		</p>
		<p>
			The extent of his devotion was shown during the time of the
			battle of Uhud. Amr saw his three sons preparing for the battle.
			He looked at the three determined young men fired by the desire
			to gain martyrdom, success and the pleasure of God. The scene had
			a great effect on him and he resolved to go out with them to wage
			jihad under the banner of the messenger of God. The youths,
			however, were all against their father carrying out his resolve.
			He was already quite old and was extremely weak.
		</p>
		<p>
			"Father," they said, "surely God has excused you. So why do you
			take this burden on yourself?"
		</p>
		<p>
			The old man became quite angry and went straight away to the
			Prophet to complain about his sons:  "O Rasulullah! My sons here
			want to keep me away from this source of goodness arguing that I
			am old and decrepit. By God, I long to attain Paradise this way
			even though I am old and infirm."
		</p>
		<p>
			"Let him," said the Prophet to his sons. "Perhaps God, the Mighty
			and the Great, will grant him martyrdom."
		</p>
		<p>
			Soon it was time to go out to battle. Amr bade farewell to his
			wife, turned to the qiblah and prayed:	"O Lord, grant me
			martyrdom and don't send me back to my family with my hopes
			dashed."  He set out in the company of his three sons and a large
			contingent from his tribe, the Banu Salamah.
		</p>
		<p>
			As the battle raged, Amr could be seen moving in the front ranks,
			jumping on his good leg (his other leg was partially lame), and
			shouting, "I desire Paradise, I desire Paradise."
		</p>
		<p>
			His son Khallad remained closely behind him and they both fought
			courageously in defense of the Prophet while many other Muslims

	<biography name="Abdullah ibn Masud">
		<p>
			When he was still a youth, not yet past the age of puberty, he
			used to roam the mountain trails of Makkah far away from people,
			tending the flocks of a Quraysh chieftain, Uqbah ibn Muayt.
			People called him "Ibn Umm Abd"--the son of the mother of a
			slave. His real name was Abdullah and his father's name was
			Masud.
		</p>
		<p>
			The youth had heard the news of the Prophet who had appeared
			among his people but he did not attach any importance to it both
			because of his age and because he was usually far away from
			Makkan society. It was his custom to leave with the flock of
			Uqbah early in the morning and not return until nightfall.
		</p>
		<p>
			One day while tending the flocks, Abdullah saw two men,
			middle-aged and of dignified bearing, coming towards him from a
			distance. They were obviously very tired. They were also so
			thirsty that their lips and throat were quite dry. They came up
			to him, greeted him and said, "Young man, milk one of these sheep
			for us that we may quench our thirst and recover our strength."
		</p>
		<p>
			"I cannot," replied the young man. "The sheep are not mine. I am
			only responsible for looking after them."
		</p>
		<p>
			The two men did not argue with him. In fact, although they were
			so thirsty, they were extremely pleased at the honest reply. The
			pleasure showed on their faces . . .
		</p>
		<p>
			The two men in fact were the blessed Prophet himself and his
			companion, Abu Bakr Siddiq. They had gone out on that day to the
			mountains of Makkah to escape the violent persecution of the
			Quraysh.
		</p>
		<p>
			The young man in turn was impressed with the Prophet and his
			companion and soon became quite attached to them.
		</p>
		<p>
			It was not long before Abdullah ibn Masud became a Muslim and
			offered to be in the service of the Prophet. The Prophet agreed
			and from that day the fortunate Abdullah ibn Masud gave up
			tending sheep in exchange for looking after the needs of the
			blessed Prophet.
		</p>
		<p>
			Abdullah ibn Masud remained closely attached to the Prophet. He
			would attend to his needs both inside and outside the house. He
			would accompany him on journeys and expeditions. He would wake
			him when he slept. He would shield him when he washed. He would
			carry his staff and his siwak (toothbrush) and attend to his
			other personal needs .
		</p>
		<p>
			Abdullah ibn Masud received a unique training in the household of
			the Prophet. He was under the guidance of the Prophet, he adopted
			his manner and followed his every trait until it was said of him,
			"He was the closest to the Prophet in character."
		</p>
		<p>
			Abdullah was taught in the 'school" of the Prophet. He was the
			best reciter of the Quran among the companions and he understood
			it better than them all. He was therefore the most knowledgeable
			on the Shariah. Nothing can illustrate this better than the story
			of the man who came to Umar ibn al-Khattab as he was standing on
			the plain of Arafat and said:
		</p>
		<p>
			"I have come, O Amir al-Mumineen, from Kufah where I left a man
			filling copies of the Quran from memory."  Umar became very angry
			and paced up and down beside his camel, fuming.  "Who is he?" he
			asked.	"Abdullah ibn Masud," replied the man.	Umar's anger
			subsided and he regained his composure.  "Woe to you," he said to
			the man. "By God, I don't know of any person left who is more
			qualified in this matter than he is. Let me tell you about this."
			 Umar continued: "One night the Messenger of God, peace be upon
			him, was having a conversation with Abu Bakr about the situation
			of Muslims. I was with them. When the Prophet left, we left with
			him also and as we passed through the mosque, there was a man
			standing in Prayer whom we did not recognize. The Prophet stood
			and listened to him, then turned to us and said, 'Whoever wants
			to read the Quran as fresh as when it was revealed, then let him
			read according to the recitation of Ibn Umm Abd.'
		</p>
		<p>
			After the Prayer, as Abdullah sat making supplications, the
			Prophet, peace be on him, said, "Ask and it will be given to you.
			Ask and it will be given to you." Umar continued: "I said to
			myself, I shall go to Abdullah ibn Masud straight away and tell
			him the good news of the Prophet's ensuring acceptance of his
			supplications. I went and did so but found that Abu Bakr had gone
			before me and conveyed the good news to him. By God, I have never
			yet beaten Abu Bakr in the doing of any good."
		</p>
		<p>
			Abdullah ibn Masud attained such a knowledge of the Quran that he
			would say, "By Him besides Whom there is no god, no verse of the
			book of God has been revealed without my knowing where it was
			revealed and the circumstances of its revelation. By God, if I
			know there was anyone who knew more of the Book of Allah, I will
			do whatever is in my power to be with him."
		</p>
		<p>
			Abdullah was not exaggerating in what he said about himself. Once
			Umar ibn al-Khattab met a caravan on one of his journeys as
			caliph. It was pitch dark and the caravan could not be seen
			properly. Umar ordered someone to hail the caravan. It happened
			that Abdullah ibn Masud was in it.
		</p>
		<p>
			"From where do you come?" asked Umar.
		</p>
		<p>
			"From a deep valley," came the reply. (The expression used fajj
			amiq deep valley--is a Quranic one).
		</p>
		<p>
			"And where are you going?" asked Umar.
		</p>
		<p>
			"To the ancient house," came the reply. (The expression used
			al-bayt al-atiq ancient house, is a Quranic one.)
		</p>
		<p>
			"There is a learned person (alim) among them," said Umar and he
			commanded someone to ask the person:
		</p>
		<p>
			"Which part of the Quran is the greatest?"
		</p>
		<p>
			"God. There is no god except Him, the Living, the
			Self-subsisting. Neither slumber overtakes Him nor sleep,"
			replied the person answering, quoting the Ayat al-Kursi (the
			verse of the Throne).
		</p>
		<p>
			"Which part of the Quran is the most clear on justice?"
		</p>
		<p>
			"God commands what it just and fair the feeding of relatives..."
			came the answer.
		</p>
		<p>
			"What it the most comprehensive statement of the Quran?'
		</p>
		<p>
			"Whoever does an atom's weight of good shall see it, and whoever
			does an atom's weight of evil shall see it."
		</p>
		<p>
			"Which part of the Quran gives risk to the greatest hope?'
		</p>
		<p>
			"Say, O my servants who have wasted their resources, do not
			despair of the mercy of God. Indeed, God forgives all sins. He is
			the Forgiving, the Compassionate."
		</p>
		<p>
			Thereupon Umar asked:
		</p>
		<p>
			"Is Abdullah ibn Masud among you?'
		</p>
		<p>
			"Yes, by God," the men in the caravan replied.
		</p>
		<p>
			Abdullah ibn Masud was not only a reciter of the Quran, a learned
			man or a fervent worshipper. He was in addition a strong and
			courageous fighter, one who became deadly serious when the
			occasion demanded it.
		</p>
		<p>
			The companions of the Prophet were together one day in Makkah.
			They were still few in number. weak and oppressed. They said,
			"The Quraysh have not yet heard the Quran being recited openly
			and loudly. Who is the man who could recite it for them?'
		</p>
		<p>
			"I shall recite it from them," volunteered Abdullah ibn Masud .
			"We are afraid for you," they said. "We only want someone who has
			a clan who would protect him from their evil . "
		</p>
		<p>
			"Let me," Abdullah ibn Masud insisted, "Allah shall protect me
			and keep me away from their evil." He then went out to the mosque
			until he reached Maqam Ibrahim (a few meters from the Kabah). It
			was dawn and the Quraysh were sitting around the Kabah. Abdullah
			stopped at the Maqam and began to recite:
		</p>
		<p>
			"Bismillah irRahma nirRahim. Ar-Rahman. Allama-l Quran. Khalaqal
			insan. Allamahul bayan... (In the name of God, the Beneficent,
			the Merciful. The Merciful God. He has taught the Quran. He has
			created man and taught him the clear truth...)"
		</p>
		<p>
			He went on reciting. The Quraysh looked at him intently and some
			of them asked:	"What is Ibn Umm Abd saying?"  "Damn him! He is
			reciting some of what Muhammad brought!" they realized.
		</p>
		<p>
			They went up to him and began beating his face as he continued
			reciting. When he went back to his companions the blood was
			flowing from his face.
		</p>
		<p>
			"This is what we feared for you," they said.  "By God," replied
			Abdullah, "the enemies of God are not more comfortable than I at
			this moment. If you wish. I shall go out tomorrow and do the
			same."	"You have done enough," they said. "You have made them
			hear what they dislike."
		</p>
		<p>
			Abdullah ibn Masud lived to the time of Khalifah Uthman, may God
			be pleased with him. When he was sick and on his death-bed,
			Uthman came to visit him and said:
		</p>
		<p>
			"What is your ailment?"
		</p>
		<p>
			"My sins."
		</p>
		<p>
			"And what do you desire?"
		</p>
		<p>
			"The mercy of my Lord."
		</p>
		<p>
			"Shall I not give you your stipend which you have refused to take
			for years now?"
		</p>
		<p>
			"I have no need of it."
		</p>
		<p>
			"Let it be for your daughters after you."
		</p>
		<p>
			"Do you fear poverty for my children? I have commanded them to
			read Surah al-Waqiah every night for I have heard the Prophet
			saying, "Whoever reads Al-Waqiah every night shall not be
			afflicted by poverty ever."
		</p>
		<p>
			That night, Abdullah passed away to the company of his Lord, his
			tongue moist with the remembrance of God and with the recitation
			of the verses of His Book.

	<biography name="Ikrimah ibn Abi Jahl">
		<p>
			He was at the end of the third decade of his life on the day the
			Prophet made public his call to guidance and truth. He was held
			in high regard by the Quraysh, being wealthy and of noble
			lineage. Some others like him, Saud ibn Abi Waqqas, Musab ibn
			Umayr and other sons of noble families in Makkah had become
			Muslims. He too might have followed their example were it not for
			his father. His father, Abu Jahl, was the foremost proponent of
			Shirk and one of the greatest tyrants of Makkah. Through torture,
			he sorely tested the faith of the early believers but they
			remained steadfast. He used every stratagem to make them waver
			but they continued to affirm the truth.
		</p>
		<p>
			Ikrimah found himself defending the leadership and authority of
			his father as he pitted himself against the Prophet. His
			animosity towards the Prophet, his persecution of his followers
			and his attempts to block the progress of Islam and the Muslims
			won the admiration of his father.
		</p>
		<p>
			At Badr, Abu Jahl led the Makkan polytheists in the battle
			against the Muslims. He swore by al-Laat and al-Uzza that he
			would not return to Makkah unless he crushed Muhammad. At Badr he
			sacrificed three camels to these goddesses. He drank wine and had
			the music of singing girls to spur the Quraysh on to fight.
		</p>
		<p>
			Abu Jahl was among the first to fall in the battle. His son
			Ikrimah saw him as spears pierced his body and heard him let out
			his last cry of agony. Ikrimah returned to Makkah leaving behind
			the corpse of the Quraysh chieftain, his father. He wanted to
			bury him in Makkah but the crushing defeat they suffered made
			this impossible.
		</p>
		<p>
			From that day, the fire of hatred burned even more fiercely in
			the heart of Ikrimah. Others whose fathers were killed at Badr,
			also became more hostile to Muhammad and his followers. This
			eventually led to the Battle of Uhud.
		</p>
		<p>
			At Uhud Ikrimah was accompanied by his wife, Umm Hakim. She and
			other women stood behind the battle lines beating their drums,
			urging the Quraysh on to battle and upbraiding any horseman who
			felt inclined to flee.
		</p>
		<p>
			Leading the right flank of the Quraysh was Khalid ibn Walid. On
			the left was Ikrimah ibn Abu Jahl. The Quraysh inflicted heavy
			losses on the Muslims and felt that they had avenged themselves
			for the defeat at Badr. This was not, however, the end of the
			state of conflict.
		</p>
		<p>
			At the battle of the Ditch, the Quraysh mushrikun besieged
			Madinah. It was a long siege. The resources and the patience of
			the mushrikun were wearing out. Ikrimah, feeling the strain of
			the siege, saw a place where the ditch, dug by the Muslims, was
			relatively narrow. With a gigantic effort, he managed to cross. A
			small group of Quraysh followed him. It was a foolhardy
			undertaking. One of them was immediately killed and it was only
			by turning on his heels that Ikrimah managed to save himself.
		</p>
		<p>
			Nine years after his hijrah, the Prophet returned with thousands
			of his companions to Makkah. The Quraysh saw them approaching and
			decided to leave the way open for them because they knew that the
			Prophet had given instructions to his commanders not to open
			hostilities. Ikrimah and some others however went against the
			consensus of the Quraysh and attempted to block the progress of
			the Muslim forces. Khalid ibn al-Walid, now a Muslim, met and
			defeated them in a small engagement during which some of
			Ikrimah's men were killed and others who could fled. Among those
			who escaped was Ikrimah himself.
		</p>
		<p>
			Any standing or influence that Ikrimah may have had was now
			completely destroyed. The Prophet, peace be upon him, entered
			Makkah and gave a general pardon and amnesty to all Quraysh who
			entered the sacred mosque, or who stayed in their houses or who
			went to the house of Abu Sufyan, the paramount Quraysh leader.
			However he refused to grant amnesty to a few individuals whom he
			named. He gave orders that they should be killed even if they
			were found under the covering of the Kabah. At the top of this
			list was Ikrimah ibn Abu Jahl. When Ikrimah learnt of this, he
			slipped out of Makkah in disguise and headed for the Yemen.
		</p>
		<p>
			Umm Hakim, Ikrimah's wife, then went to the camp of the Prophet.
			With her was Hind bint Utbah, the wife of Abu Sufyan and the
			mother of Muawiyah, and about ten other women who wanted to
			pledge allegiance to the Prophet. At the camp, were two of his
			wives, his daughter Fatimah and some women of the Abdulmuttalib
			clan. Hind was the one who spoke. She was veiled and ashamed of
			what she had done to Hamzah, the Prophet's uncle, at the battle
			of Uhud.
		</p>
		<p>
			"O Messenger of God," she said, "Praise be to God Who has made
			manifest the religion He has chosen for Himself. I beseech you
			out of the bonds of kinship to treat me well. I am now a
			believing woman who affirms the Truth of your mission." She then
			unveiled herself and said:
		</p>
		<p>
			"I am Hind, the daughter of Utbah, O Messenger of God. "
		</p>
		<p>
			"Welcome to you," replied the Prophet, peace be on him.
		</p>
		<p>
			"By God, O Prophet" continued Hind, "there was not a house on
			earth that I wanted to destroy more than your house. Now, there
			is no house on earth that I so dearly wish to honor and raise in
			glory than yours."
		</p>
		<p>
			Umm Hakim then got up and professed her faith in Islam and said:
			"O Messenger of God, Ikrimah has fled from you to the Yemen out
			of fear that you would kill him. Grant him security and God will
			grant you security."
		</p>
		<p>
			"He is secure," promised the Prophet.  Umm Hakim set out
			immediately in search of Ikrimah. Accompanying her was a Greek
			slave. When they had gone quite far on the way, he tried to
			seduce her but she managed to put him off until she came to a
			settlement of Arabs. She sought their help against him. They tied
			him up and kept him. Umm Hakim continued on her way until she
			finally found Ikrimah on the coast of the Red Sea in the region
			of Tihamah. He was negotiating transport with a Muslim seaman who
			was saying to him:
		</p>
		<p>
			"Be pure and sincere and I will transport you."
		</p>
		<p>
			"How can I be pure?" asked Ikrimah.
		</p>
		<p>
			"Say, I testify that there is no god but Allah and that Muhammad
			is the Messenger of Allah."
		</p>
		<p>
			"I have fled from this very thing," said Ikrimah.
		</p>
		<p>
			At this point, Umm Haklm came up to Ikrimah and said:
		</p>
		<p>
			"O cousin, I have come to you from the most generous of men, the
			most righteous of men, the best of men . . . from Muhammad ibn
			Abdullah. I have asked him for an amnesty for you. This he has
			granted. So do not destroy yourself. "
		</p>
		<p>
			"Have you spoken to him?"
		</p>
		<p>
			"Yes, I have spoken to him and he has granted you amnesty," she
			assured him and he returned with her. She told him about the
			attempt of their Greek slave to dishonor her and Ikrimah went
			directly to the Arab settlement where he lay bound and killed
			him.
		</p>
		<p>
			At one of their resting places on their way back, Ikrimah wanted
			to sleep with his wife but she vehemently refused and said:
		</p>
		<p>
			"I am a Muslimah and you are a Mushrik."
		</p>
		<p>
			Ikrimah was totally taken aback and said, "Living without you and
			without your sleeping with me is an impossible situation."  As
			Ikrimah approached Makkah, the Prophet, peace be upon him, told
			his companions: "Ikrimah ibn Abu Jahl shall come to you as a
			believer and a muhajir (a refugee). Do not insult his father.
			Insulting the dead causes grief to the living and does not reach
			the dead."
		</p>
		<p>
			Ikrimah and his wife came up to where the Prophet was sitting.
			The Prophet got up and greeted him enthusiastically.
		</p>
		<p>
			"Muhammad," said Ikrimah, "Umm Hakim has told me that you have
			granted me an amnesty."
		</p>
		<p>
			"That's right," said the Prophet, "You are safe."
		</p>
		<p>
			"To what do you invite?" asked Ikrimah.
		</p>
		<p>
			"I invite you to testify that there is no god but Allah and that
			I am the servant of Allah and His messenger, to establish Prayer
			and pay the Zakat and carry out all the other obligations of
			Islam."
		</p>
		<p>
			"By God," responded Ikrimah, "You have only called to what is
			true and you have only commanded that which is good. You lived
			among us before the start of your mission and then you were the
			most trustworthy of us in speech and the most righteous of us."
			Stretching forth his hands he said, "I testify that there is no
			god but Allah and that Muhammad is His servant and His
			messenger." The Prophet then instructed him to say, "I call on
			God and those present here to witness that I am a Muslim who is a
			Mujahid and a Muhajir". This Ikrimah repeated and then said:
		</p>
		<p>
			"I ask you to ask God for forgiveness for me for all the
			hostility I directed against you and for whatever insults I
			expressed in your presence or absence." The Prophet replied with
			the prayer:
		</p>
		<p>
			"O Lord, forgive him for all the hostility he directed against me
			and from all the expeditions he mounted wishing to put out Your
			light. Forgive him for whatever he has said or done in my
			presence or absence to dishonor me."
		</p>
		<p>
			Ikrimahs face beamed with happiness.
		</p>
		<p>
			"By God, O messenger of Allah, I promise that whatever I have
			spent obstructing the way of God, I shall spend twice as much in
			His path and whatever battles I have fought against God's way I
			shall fight twice as much in His way."
		</p>
		<p>
			From that day on, Ikrimah was committed to the mission of Islam
			as brave horseman in the field of battle and as a steadfast
			worship per who would spend much time in mosques rending the book
			of God. Often he would place the mushaf on his face and say, "The
			Book of my Lord, the words of my Lord" and he would cry from the
			fear of God.
		</p>
		<p>
			Ikrimah remained true to his pledge to the Prophet. Whatever
			battles the Muslims engaged in thereafter, he participated in
			them and he was always in the vanguard of the army. At the battle
			of Yarmuk he plunged into the attack as a thirsty person after
			cold water on a blistering hot day. In one encounter in which the
			Muslims were under heavy attack, Ikrimah penetrated deep into the
			ranks of the Byzantine. Khalid ibn al-Walid rushed up to him and
			said, "Don't, Ikrimah. Your death will be a severe blow to the
			Muslims."
		</p>
		<p>
			"Let us carry on, Khalid," said Ikrimah, now at the peak of
			motivation. "You had the privilege of being with the Messenger of
			God before this. As for myself and my father, we were among his
			bitterest enemies. Leave me now to atone for what I have done in
			the past. I fought the Prophet on many occasions. Shall I now
			flee from the Byzantines? This shall never be." Then calling out
			to the Muslims, he shouted, "Who shall pledge to fight until
			death?"
		</p>
		<p>
			Four hundred Muslims including al-Harith ibn Hisham and Ayyash
			ibn Abi Rabiah responded to his call. They plunged into the
			battle and fought heroically without the leadership of Khalid ibn
			al-Walid. Their daring attack paved the way for a decisive Muslim
			victory.
		</p>
		<p>
			When the battle was over, the bodies of three wounded mujahideen
			lay sprawled on the battleground, among them Al-Harith ibn
			Hisham, Ayyash ibn Abi Rabiah and Ikrimah ibn Abu Jahl. Al-Harith
			called for water to drink. As it was brought to him, Ayyash
			looked at him and Harith said:
		</p>
		<p>
			"Give it to Ayyash." By the time they got to Ayyash, he had just
			breathed his last. When they returned to al-Harith and Ikrimaha,
			they found that they too had passed away.
		</p>
		<p>
			The companions prayed that God may be pleased with them all and
			grant them refreshment from the spring of Kawthar in Paradise, a
			refreshment after which there is thirst no more.

	<biography name="Al-Baraa ibn Malik al-Ansari">
		<p>
			His hair looked dishevelled and his whole appearance was unkempt.
			He was thin and wiry with so little flesh on his bones that it
			was painful to look at him. Yet in single handed combat he
			defeated and killed many opponents and in the thick of battle he
			was an outstanding fighter against the mushrikeen. He was so
			courageous and daring that Umar once wrote to his governors
			throughout the Islamic state that they should not appoint him to
			lead any army out of fear that he would have them all killed by
			his daring exploits. This man was al-Baraa ibn Malik al-Ansari,
			the brother of Anas ibn Malik, the personal aide of the Prophet.
		</p>
		<p>
			If the tales of Baraa's heroism were to be told in detail pages
			and pages could be written. But let one example suffice .
		</p>
		<p>
			This particular story begins only hours after the death of the
			noble Prophet when many Arabian tribes took to leaving the
			religion of God in large numbers, just as they had entered it in
			large numbers. Within a short space of time only the people of
			Makkah, Madinah and Taif and scattered communities here and
			there, whose commitment to Islam was unwavering, remained within
			the religion.
		</p>
		<p>
			Abu Bakr as-Siddiq, the successor to the Prophet, stood firm
			against this blind and destructive movement. From the Muhajireen
			and Ansar, he mobilized eleven armies each under a separate
			commander and dispatched them to various parts of the Arabian
			peninsula. Their purpose was to make the apostates return to the
			path of guidance and truth and to confront the leaders of the
			rebellion.
		</p>
		<p>
			The strongest group of apostates and the greatest in number were
			the Banu Hanifah among whom Musaylamah the Imposter arose,
			claiming that he was a prophet. Musaylamah managed to mobilize
			forty thousand of the best fighters among his people. Most of
			these however followed him for the sake of Allah or tribal
			loyalty and not because they believed in him. One of them in fact
			said, "I testify that Musaylamah is an impostor and that Muhammad
			is true but the impostor of Rabiah (Musaylamah) is dearer to us
			than the true man of Mudar (Muhammad ). "
		</p>
		<p>
			Musaylamah routed the first army sent against him under the
			leadership of Ikrimah ibn Abi Jahl. Abu Bakr dispatched another
			army against Musaylamah led by Khalid ibn al-Walid. This army
			included the cream of the Sahabah from both the Ansar and the
			Muhajireen. In the front ranks of this army was Baraa ibn Malik
			and a group of the most valiant Muslims.
		</p>
		<p>
			The two armies met in the territory of the Banu Hanifah at
			Yamamah in Najd. Before long, the scale of battle tilted in favor
			of Musaylamah and his men. The Muslim armies began to retreat
			from their positions. Musaylamah's forces even stormed the tent
			of Khalid ibn Walid and drove him from his position. They would
			have killed his wife if one of them had not granted her
			protection.
		</p>
		<p>
			At that point, the Muslims realized in what a perilous situation
			they were. They were also conscious of the fact that if they were
			annihilated by Musaylamah, Islam would not be able to stand as a
			religion and Allah--the One God with whom there is no
			partner--would not be worshipped in the Arabian peninsula after
			that.
		</p>
		<p>
			Khalid mustered his forces once more and began reorganizing them.
			He separate(i the Muhajireen and the Ansar and kept men from
			different tribes apart. Each was put under the leadership of one
			of its own members so that the losses of each group in the battle
			might be known.
		</p>
		<p>
			The battle raged. There was much destruction and death. The
			Muslims had not experienced anything like this in all the wars
			they had fought before. Musaylamah's men remained firm amidst the
			tumult, as firm as immovable mountains although many of them had
			fallen.
		</p>
		<p>
			The Muslims displayed tremendous feats of heroism. Thabit ibn
			Qays, the standard bearer of the Ansar, dug a pit and planted
			himself in it and fought until he was killed. The pit he dug
			turned out to be his grave. Zayd ibn al-Khattab, brother of Umar
			ibn al-Khattab, may God be pleased with them both, called out to
			the Muslims: "Men, bite with your jaw teeth, strike the enemy and
			press on. By God, I shall not speak to you after this until
			either Musaylamah is defeated or I meet God." He then charged
			against the enemy and continued fighting until he was killed.
			Salim, the mawla of Abu Hudhaifah, and standard bearer of the
			Muhajireen displayed unexpected valor. His people feared that he
			would show weakness or be too terrified to fight. To them he
			said, "If you manage to overtake me, what a miserable bearer of
			the Quran I shall be." He then valiantly plunged into the enemy
			ranks and eventually fell as a martyr.
		</p>
		<p>
			The bravery of all these, however, wanes in front of the heroism
			of al-Baraa ibn Malik, may God be pleased with him and with them
			all.
		</p>
		<p>
			As the battle grew fiercer and fiercer, Khalid turned to al-Baraa
			and said, "Charge, young man of the Ansar." Al-Baraa turned to
			his men and said, "O Ansar, let not anyone of you think of
			returning to Madinah. There is no Madinah for you after this day.
			There is only Allah, then Paradise."
		</p>
		<p>
			He and the Ansar then launched their attack against the
			mushrikeen, breaking their ranks and dealing telling blows
			against them until eventually they began to withdraw. They sought
			refuge in a garden which later became known in history as The
			Garden of Death because of the many killed there on that day. The
			garden was surrounded by high walls. Musaylamah and thousands of
			his men entered and closed the gates behind them and fortified
			themselves.
		</p>
		<p>
			From their new positions they began to rain down arrows on the
			Muslims.
		</p>
		<p>
			The valiant Baraa went forward and addressed his company, "Put me
			on a shield. Raise the shield on spears and hurl me into the
			garden near the gate. Either I shall die a martyr or I shall open
			the gate for you."
		</p>
		<p>
			The thin and wiry al-Baraa was soon sitting on a shield. A number
			of spears raised the shield and he was thrown into the Garden of
			Death amongst the multitude of Musaylamah's men. He descended on
			them like a thunderbolt and continued to fight them in front of
			the gate. Many fell to his sword and he himself sustained
			numerous wounds before he could open the gate.
		</p>
		<p>
			The Muslims charged into the Garden of Death through the gates
			and over the walls. Fighting was bitter and at close quarters and
			hundreds were killed. Finally the Muslims came upon Musaylamah
			and he was killed.
		</p>
		<p>
			Al Baraa was taken in a litter to Madinah. Khalid ibn al-Walid
			spent a month looking after him and tending his wounds.
			Eventually his condition improved. Through him the Muslims had
			gained victory over Musaylamah.
		</p>
		<p>
			In spite of recovering from his wounds, al-Baraa continued to
			long for the martyrdom which had eluded him at the Garden of
			Death. He went on fighting in battle after battle hoping to
			attain his aim. This came at the battle for Tustar in Persia.
		</p>
		<p>
			At Tustar the Persians were besieged in one of their defiant
			fortresses. The siege was long and when its effects became quite
			unbearable, they adopted a new tactic. From the walls of the
			fortress, they began to throw down iron chains at the ends of
			which were fastened iron hooks which were red hot. Muslims were
			caught by these hooks and were pulled up either dead or in the
			agony of death.
		</p>
		<p>
			One of these hooks got hold of Anas ibn Malik, the brother of
			al-Baraa. As soon as al-Baraa saw this, he leapt up the wall of
			the fortress and grabbed the chain which bore his brother and
			began undoing the hook from his body. His hand began to burn but
			he did not let go before his brother was released.
		</p>
		<p>
			Baraa himself died during this battle. He had prayed to God to
			grant him martyrdom.

	<biography name="Asmaa bint Abu Bakr">
		<p>
			Asmaa bint Abu Bakr belonged to a distinguished Muslim family.
			Her father, Abu Bakr, was a close friend of the Prophet and the
			first Khalifah after his death. Her halfsister, Aishah, was a
			wife of the Prophet and one of the Ummahat al-Mumineen. Her
			husband, Zubayr ibn al-Awwam, was one of the special personal
			aides of the Prophet. Her son, Abdullah ibn az-Zubayr, became
			well known for his incorruptibility and his unswerving devotion
			to Truth.
		</p>
		<p>
			Asma a herself was one of the first persons to accept Islam. Only
			about seventeen persons including both men and women became
			Muslims before her. She was later given the nickname Dhat
			an-Nitaqayn (the One with the Two Waistbands) because of an
			incident connected with the departure of the Prophet and her
			father from Makkah on the historic hijrah to Madinah.
		</p>
		<p>
			Asma a was one of the few persons who knew of the Prophet's plan
			to leave for Madinah. The utmost secrecy had to be maintained
			because of the Quraysh plans to murder the Prophet. On the night
			of their departure, Asmaa was the one who prepared a bag of food
			and a water container for their journey. She did not find
			anything though with which to tie the containers and decided to
			use her waistband or nitaq. Abu Bakr suggested that she tear it
			into two. This she did and the Prophet commended her action. From
			then on she became known as "the One with the Two Waistbands".
		</p>
		<p>
			When the final emigration from Makkah to Madinah took place soon
			aster the departure of the Prophet, Asmaa was pregnant. She did
			not let her pregnancy or the prospect of a long and arduous
			journey deter her from leaving. As soon as she reached Quba on
			the outskirts of Madinah, she gave birth to a son, Abdullah. The
			Muslims shouted Allahu Akbar (God is the Greatest) and Laa ilaaha
			illa Allah (There is no God but Allah) in happiness and
			thanksgiving because this was the first child to be born to the
			muhajireen in Madinah.
		</p>
		<p>
			Asma a became known from her tine and noble qualities and for the
			keenness of her intelligence. She was an extremely generous
			person. Her son Abdullah once said of her, "I have not seen two
			women more generous than my aunt Aishah and my mother Asmaa. But
			their generosity was expressed in different ways. My aunt would
			accumulate one thing after another until she had gathered what
			she felt was sufficient and then distributed it all to those in
			need. My mother, on the other hand, would not keep anything even
			for the morrow."
		</p>
		<p>
			Asma's presence of mind in difficult circumstances was
			remarkable. When her father let Makkah, he took all his wealth,
			amounting to some six thousand dirhams, with him and did not
			leave any for his family. When Abu Bakr's father, Abu Quhafah (he
			was still a mushrik) heard of his departure he went to his house
			and said to Asmaa:
		</p>
		<p>
			"I understand that he has left you bereft of money after he
			himself has abandoned you."
		</p>
		<p>
			"No, grandfather," replied Asmaa, "in fact he has left us much
			money." She took some pebbles and put them in a small recess in
			the wall where they used to put money. She threw a cloth over the
			heap and took the hand of her grandfather--he was blind--and
			said, "See how much money he has left us".
		</p>
		<p>
			Through this stratagem, Asmaa wanted to allay the fears of the
			old man and to forestall him from giving them anything of his own
			wealth. This was because she disliked receiving any assistance
			from a mushrikeen if it was her own grandfather.
		</p>
		<p>
			She had a similar attitude to her mother and was not inclined to
			compromise her honor and her faith. Her mother, Qutaylah, once
			came to visit her in Madinah. She was not a Muslim and was
			divorced from her father in pre-Islamic times. Her mother brought
			her gifts of raisins, clarified butter and qaraz (pods of a
			species of sant tree). Asma at first refused to admit her into
			her house or accept the gifts. She sent someone to Aishah to ask
			the Prophet, peace be upon him, about her attitude to her mother
			and he replied that she should certainly admit her to her house
			and accept the gifts. On this occasion, the following revelation
			came to the Prophet:
		</p>
		<p>
			"God forbids you not, with regard to those who do not fight you
			because of your faith nor drive you out of your homes, from
			dealing kindly and justly with them. God loves those who are
			just. God only forbids you with regard to those who fight you for
			your Faith, and drive you from your homes, and support others in
			driving you out, from turning to them (for friendship and
			protection). It is such as turn to them (in these circumstances)
			that do wrong." (Surah al-Mumtahanah 6O: 8-9).
		</p>
		<p>
			For Asmaa and indeed for many other Muslims, life in Madinah was
			rather difficult at first. Her husband was quite poor and his
			only major possession to begin with was a horse he had bought.
			Asma a herself described these early days:
		</p>
		<p>
			"I used to provide fodder for the horse, give it water and groom
			it. I would grind grain and make dough but I could not bake well.
			The women of the Ansar used to bake for me. They were truly good
			women. I used to carry the grain on my head from az-Zubayr's plot
			which the Prophet had allocated to him to cultivate. It was about
			three farsakh (about eight kilo meters) from the town's center.
			One day I was on the road carrying the grain on my head when I
			met the Prophet and a group of Sahabah. He called out to me and
			stopped his camel so that I could ride behind him. I felt
			embarrassed to travel with the Prophet and also remembered
			az-Zubayr's jealousy, he was the most jealous of men. The Prophet
			realized that I was embarrassed and rode on."
		</p>
		<p>
			Later, Asmaa related to az-Zubayr exactly what had happened and
			he said, "By God, that you should have to carry grain is far more
			distressing to me than your riding with (the Prophet)".
		</p>
		<p>
			Asma a obviously then was a person of great sensitivity and
			devotion. She and her husband worked extremely hard together
			until their situation of poverty gradually changed. At times,
			however, az-Zubayr treated her harshly. Once she went to her
			father and complained to him about this. His reply to her was:
			'My daughter, have sabr for if a woman has a righteous husband
			and he dies and she does not marry after him, they will be
			brought together again in Paradise."
		</p>
		<p>
			Az-Zubayr eventually became one of the richest men among the
			Sahabah but Asmaa did not allow this to corrupt her principles.
			Her son, al-Mundhir once sent her an elegant dress from Iraq made
			of fine and costly material. Asmaa by this time was blind. She
			felt the material and said, "It's awful. Take it back to him".
		</p>
		<p>
			Al-Mundhir was upset and said, "Mother. it was not transparent .
			"
		</p>
		<p>
			"It may not be transparent," she retorted, "but it is too tight
			fitting and shows the contours of the body."
		</p>
		<p>
			Al-Mundhir bought another dress that met with her approval and
			she accepted it.
		</p>
		<p>
			If the above incidents and aspects of Asmaas life may easily be
			forgotten, then her final meeting with her son, Abdullah, must
			remain one of the most unforgettable moments in early Muslim
			history. At that meeting she demonstrated the keenness of her
			intelligence, her resoluteness and the strength of her faith.
		</p>
		<p>
			Abdullah was in the running for the Caliphate after the death of
			Yazid ibn Muawiyah. The Hijaz, Egypt, Iraq, Khurasan and much of
			Syria were favorable to him and acknowledged him as the Caliph.
			The Ummayyads however continued to contest the Caliphate and to
			field a massive army under the command of Al-Hajjaj ibn Yusuf
			ath-Thaqafi. Relentless battles were fought between the two sides
			during which Abdullah ibn az-Zubayr displayed great acts of
			courage and heroism. Many of his supporters however could not
			withstand the continuous strain of battle and gradually began to
			desert him. Finally he sought refuge in the Sacred Mosque at
			Makkah. It was then that he went to his mother, now an old blind
			woman, and said:
		</p>
		<p>
			"Peace be on you, Mother, and the mercy and blessings of God." 
			"Unto you be peace, Abdullah," she replied. "What is it that
			brings you here at this hour while boulders from Hajjaj's
			catapults are raining down on your soldiers in the Haram and
			shaking the houses of Makkah?"
		</p>
		<p>
			"I came to seek your advice," he said.
		</p>
		<p>
			"To seek my advice?" she asked in astonishment. "About what?"
		</p>
		<p>
			"The people have deserted me out of fear of Hajjaj or being
			tempted by what he has to offer. Even my children and my family
			have left me. There is only a small group of men with me now and
			however strong and steadfast they are they can only resist for an
			hour or two more. Messengers of the Banu Umayyah (the Umayyads)
			are now negotiating with me, offering to give me whatever worldly
			possessions I want, should I lay down my arms and swear
			allegiance to Abdul Malik ibn Marwan. What do you think?"
		</p>
		<p>
			Raising her voice, she replied: "It's your affair, Abdullah, and
			you know yourself better. If however you think that you are right
			and that you are standing up for the Truth, then persevere and
			fight on as your companions who were killed under your flag had
			shown perseverance. If however you desire the world, what a
			miserable wretch you are. You would have destroyed yourself and
			you would have destroyed your men."
		</p>
		<p>
			"But I will be killed today, there is no doubt about it."
		</p>
		<p>
			"That is better for you than that you should surrender yourself
			to Hajjaj voluntarily and that some minions of Banu Umayyah
			should play with your head."
		</p>
		<p>
			"I do not fear death. I am only afraid that they will mutilate
			me."
		</p>
		<p>
			"There is nothing after death that man should be afraid of.
			Skinning does not cause any pain to the slaughtered sheep."
		</p>
		<p>
			Abdullah's face beamed as he said: "What a blessed mother!
			Blessed be your noble qualities! I have come to you at this hour
			to hear what I have heard. God knows that I have not weakened or
			despaired. He is witness over me that I have not stood up for
			what I have out of love for this world and its attractions but
			only out of anger for the sake of God. His limits have been
			transgressed. Here am I, going to what is pleasing to you. So if
			I am killed, do not grieve for me and commend me to God."
		</p>
		<p>
			"I shall grieve for you," said the aging but resolute Asmaa,
			"only if you are killed in a vain and unjust cause."
		</p>
		<p>
			"Be assured that your son has not supported an unjust cause, nor
			committed any detestable deed, nor done any injustice to a Muslim
			or a Dhimmi and that there is nothing better in his sight than
			the pleasure of God, the Mighty, the Great. I do not say this to
			exonerate myself. God knows that I have only said it to make your
			heart firm and steadfast. "
		</p>
		<p>
			"Praise be to God who has made you act according to what He likes
			and according to what I like. Come close to me, my son, that I
			may smell and feel your body for this might be the last meeting
			with you."
		</p>
		<p>
			Abdullah knelt before her. She hugged him and smothered his head,
			his face and his neck with kisses. Her hands began to squeeze his
			body when suddenly she withdrew them and asked:
		</p>
		<p>
			"What is this you are wearing, Abdullah?"
		</p>
		<p>
			"This is my armor plate."
		</p>
		<p>
			"This, my son, is not the dress of one who desires martyrdom.
			Take it off. That will make your movements lighter and quicker.
			Wear instead the sirwal (a long under garment) so that if you are
			killed your awrah will not be exposed.
		</p>
		<p>
			Abdullah took off his armor plate and put on the sirwal. As he
			left for the Haram to join the fighting he said:  "My mother,
			don't deprive me of your dua (prayer)."
		</p>
		<p>
			Raising her hands to heaven, she prayed: "O Lord, have mercy on
			his staying up for long hours and his loud crying in the darkness
			of the night while people slept... "O Lord, have mercy on his
			hunger and his thirst on his Journeys from Madinah and Makkah
			while he fasted... "O Lord, bless his righteousness to his mother
			and his father... "O Lord, I commend him to Your cause and I am
			pleased with whatever You decree for him. And grant me for his
			sake the reward of those who are patient and who persevere."
		</p>
		<p>
			By sunset, Abdullah was dead. Just over ten days later, his
			mother joined him. She was a hundred years old. Age had not made
			her infirm nor blunted the keenness of her mind.

	<biography name="Abdullah ibn Hudhafah as-Sahmi">
		<p>
			History would have by-passed this man as it had bypassed
			thousands of Arabs before him. He, like them, would have had no
			claim to attention or fame. The greatness of Islam, however, gave
			to Abdullah ibn Hudhafah the opportunity to meet two world
			potentates of his time--Khusraw Parvez the King of Persia and
			Heraclius, the Byzantine emperor.
		</p>
		<p>
			The story of his encounter with Khusraw Parvez began in the sixth
			year of the hijrah when the Prophet decided to send some of his
			Companions with letters to rulers outside the Arabian peninsula
			inviting them to Islam.
		</p>
		<p>
			The Prophet attached great importance to this initiative. These
			messengers were going to distant lands with whom there was no
			agreement or treaty. They did not know the languages of these
			lands nor anything about the ways and disposition of their
			rulers. They were to invite these rulers to give up their
			religion and forsake their power and glory and enter the religion
			of a people who shortly before were almost their subjects. The
			mission was undoubtedly hazardous.
		</p>
		<p>
			To make known his plan, the Prophet called his companions
			together and addressed them. He started by praising God and
			thanking Him. He then recited the Shahadah and went on:
		</p>
		<p>
			"I want to send some of you to the rulers of foreign lands but
			don't dispute with me as the Israelites disputed with Jesus, the
			son of Mary.  "O Prophet of God, we shall carry out whatever you
			wish," they responded. "Send us wherever you desire."
		</p>
		<p>
			The Prophet commissioned six of his Sahabah to carry his letters
			to Arab and foreign rulers. One of these was Abdullah ibn
			Hudhafah. He was chosen to take the Prophet's letter to Khusraw
			Parvez, the Persian king.
		</p>
		<p>
			Abdullah got his camel ready and bade farewell to his wife and
			son. He set out, alone, and traversed mountains and valleys until
			he reached the land of the Persian.
		</p>
		<p>
			He sought permission to enter into the king's presence informing
			the guards of the letter he was carrying. Khusraw Parvez
			thereupon ordered his audience chamber to be made ready and
			summoned his prominent aides. When they had assembled he gave
			permission for Abdullah to enter.
		</p>
		<p>
			Abdullah entered and saw the Persian potentate dressed in
			delicate, flowing robes and wearing a great, neatly arranged
			turban. On Abdullah was the plain, coarse clothes of the bedouin.
			His head though was held high and his feet were firm. The honor
			of Islam burned fiercely in his breast and the power of faith
			pulsated in his heart.
		</p>
		<p>
			As soon as Khusraw Parvez saw him approaching he signal led to
			one of his men to take the letter from his hand.
		</p>
		<p>
			"No," said Abdullah. 'The Prophet commanded me to hand over this
			letter to you directly and I shall not go against a command of
			the Messenger of God."
		</p>
		<p>
			"Let him come near to me," Khusraw said to his guards and
			Abdullah went forward and handed over the letter. Khusraw then
			called an Arab clerk who originally came from Hira and ordered
			him to open the letter in his presence and read its contents. He
			began reading:
		</p>
		<p>
			"In the name of Allah, the Beneficent the Merciful. From
			Muhammad, the Messenger of God, to Khusraw the ruler of Persia.
			Peace on whoever follows the guidance . . ."
		</p>
		<p>
			Khusraw only heard this much of the letter when the fire of anger
			burst within him. His face became red and he began to perspire
			around the neck. He snatched the letter from the clerk's hand and
			began tearing it to pieces without knowing what else it contained
			and shouted, "Does he dare to write to me like this, he who is my
			slave". He was angry that the Prophet had not given him
			precedence in his letter. He then commanded Abdullah to be
			expelled from his assembly.
		</p>
		<p>
			Abdullah was taken away, not knowing what would happen to him.
			Would he be killed or would he be set free? But he did not want
			to wait to find out. He said, "By God, I don't care what happens
			to me after the letter of the Prophet has been so badly treated."
			He managed to get to his camel and rode off.
		</p>
		<p>
			When Khusraw's anger had subsided he commanded that Abdullah be
			brought before him. But Abdullah was nowhere to be found. They
			searched for him all the way to the Arabian peninsula but found
			that he had gone ahead.
		</p>
		<p>
			Back in Madinah, Abdullah told the Prophet how Khusraw had torn
			his letter to pieces and the Prophet's only reply was, "May God
			tear up his kingdom".
		</p>
		<p>
			Meanwhile, Khusraw wrote to Badhan, his deputy in the Yemen, to
			send two strong men to "that man who has appeared in the Hijaz"
			with orders to bring him to Persia.
		</p>
		<p>
			Badhan dispatched two of his strongest men to the Prophet and
			gave them a letter to him in which he was ordered to go with the
			two men to meet Khusraw without delay. Badhan also asked the two
			men to get whatever information they could on the Prophet and to
			study his message closely.
		</p>
		<p>
			The men set out, moving very quickly. At Taif they met some
			Quraysh traders and asked them about Muhammad. "He is in
			Yathrib," they said and they went on to Makkah feeling extremely
			happy. This was good news for them and they went around telling
			other Quraysh, "You will be pleased. Khusraw is out to get
			Muhammad and you will be rid of his evil."
		</p>
		<p>
			The two men meanwhile made straight for Madinah where they met
			the Prophet, handed him the letter of Badhan and said to him,
			"The king of kings, Khusraw, has written to our ruler Badhan to
			send his men to get you. We have come to take you with us. If you
			come willingly, Khusraw has said that it will be good for you and
			he will spare you any punishment. If you refuse, you will know
			the power of his punishment. He has power to destroy you and your
			people."
		</p>
		<p>
			The Prophet smiled and said to them, "Go back to your mounts
			today and return tomorrow."
		</p>
		<p>
			On the following day, they came to the Prophet and said to him,
			"Are you prepared to go with us to meet Khusraw?"
		</p>
		<p>
			"You shall not meet Khusraw after today," replied the Prophet.
			"God has killed him and his son Shirwaih has taken his place on
			such a night and on such a month."
		</p>
		<p>
			The two men stared in the face of the Prophet. They were
			completely dumbfounded.
		</p>
		<p>
			"Do you know what you are saying?" they asked. "Shall we write
			about this to Badhan?"
		</p>
		<p>
			"Yes," replied the Prophet, "and say to him that my religion has
			informed me about what has happened to the Kingdom of Khusraw and
			that if he should become Muslim, I would appoint him ruler over
			what he now controls".
		</p>
		<p>
			The two men returned to the Yemen and told Badhan what had
			happened. Badhan said, "If what Muhammad has said is true, then
			he is a Prophet. If not then we shall see what happens to him."
		</p>
		<p>
			Not long afterwards a letter from Shirwaih came to Badhan in
			which he said, "I killed Khusraw because of his tyranny against
			our people. He regarded as lawful the killing of leaders, the
			capturing of their women and the expropriating of their wealth.
			When this my letter reaches you, take the allegiance of whoever
			is with you on my behalf."
		</p>
		<p>
			As soon as Badhan had read Shirwaih's letter, he threw it aside
			and announced his entry into Islam. The Persians with him in the
			Yemen also became Muslim.
		</p>
		<p>
			That's the story of Abdullah ibn Hudhafah's meeting with the
			Persian king. His meeting with the Byzantine emperor took place
			during the caliphate of Umar ibn al-Khattab. It too is an
			astonishing story.
		</p>
		<p>
			In the nineteenth year after the Hijrah, Umar dispatched an army
			to fight against the Byzantine. In it was Abdullah ibn Hudhafah.
			News of the Muslim force reached the Byzantine emperor. He had
			heard of their sincerity of faith, and their willingness to
			sacrifice their lives in the way of God and His Prophet. He gave
			orders to his men to bring to him any Muslim captive they might
			take alive.
		</p>
		<p>
			God willed that Abdullah ibn Hudhafah should fall captive to the
			Byzantines and he was brought before the Emperor. The Emperor
			looked at Abdullah for a long time. Suddenly he said, "I shall
			make a proposal to you."
		</p>
		<p>
			"What is it?" asked Abdullah.  "I suggest that you become a
			Christian. If you do this, you will be set free and I shall grant
			you a safe refuge."  The prisoner's reaction was furious: "Death
			is preferable to me a thousand times to what you ask me to do."
		</p>
		<p>
			"I see that you are a bold man. However, if you respond
			positively to what I propose to you, I will give you a share in
			my authority and swear you in as my aide."
		</p>
		<p>
			The prisoner, shackled in his chains, smiled and said, "By God,
			if you give me all that you possess and all that the Arabs have
			in exchange for giving up the religion of Muhammad, I shall not
			do so."
		</p>
		<p>
			"Then I shall kill you."
		</p>
		<p>
			"Do what you want," answered Abdullah.
		</p>
		<p>
			The emperor then had him put on a cross and ordered his soldiers
			to throw spears at him, first near his hands and then near his
			feet, all the while telling him to accept Christianity or at
			least give up his religion. This he refused over and over again
			to do.
		</p>
		<p>
			The emperor then had him taken down from the wooden cross. He
			called for a great pot to be brought. This was filled with oil
			which was then heated under a fierce fire. He then had two other
			Muslim prisoners brought and had one of them thrown into the
			boiling oil. The prisoner's flesh sizzled and soon his bones
			could be seen. The emperor turned to Abdullah and invited him to
			Christianity.
		</p>
		<p>
			This was the most terrible test that Abdullah had to face up till
			now. But he remained firm and the emperor gave up trying. He then
			ordered that Abdullah too be thrown into the pot. As he was being
			taken away he began to shed tears. The emperor thought that he
			had at last been broken and had him brought back to him. He once
			more suggested that Abdullah become a Christian but to his
			astonishment, Abdullah refused.
		</p>
		<p>
			"Damn you! Why did you weep then?" shouted the emperor.
		</p>
		<p>
			"I cried," said Abdullah, "because I said to myself 'You will now
			be thrown into this pot and your soul will depart'. What I really
			desired then was to have as many souls as the number of hairs on
			my body and to have all of them thrown into this pot for the sake
			of God."
		</p>
		<p>
			The tyrant then said, "Will you kiss my head? I will then set you
			free?"

		<p>
			"And all the Muslim prisoners also?" asked Abdullah.
		</p>
		<p>
			This the emperor agreed to do and Abdullah said to himself, "One
			of the enemies of God! I shall kiss his head and he shall set me
			and all other Muslim prisoners free. There can be no blame on me
			for doing this." He then went up to the emperor and kissed his
			forehead. All the Muslim prisoners were released and handed over
			to Abdullah.
		</p>
		<p>
			Abdullah ibn Hudhafah eventually came to Umar ibn al-Khattab and
			told him what had happened. Umar was greatly pleased and when he
			looked at the prisoners he said, "Every Muslim has a duty to kiss
			the head of Abdullah ibn Khudhafah and I shall start."	Umar then
			got up and kissed the head of Abdullah ibn Hudhafah .

	<biography name="Abdullah ibn Jahsh">
		<p>
			Abdullah ibn Jahsh was a cousin of the Prophet and his sister,
			Zaynab bint Jahsh, was a wife of the Prophet. He was the first to
			head a group of Muslims on an expedition and so was the first to
			be called "Amir al-Mumineen"-- Commander of the Believers.
		</p>
		<p>
			Abdullah ibn Jahsh became a Muslim before the Prophet entered the
			House of al-Arqam which became a meeting place, a school and a
			place of refuge for the early Muslims. He was thus one of the
			first to accept Islam.
		</p>
		<p>
			When the Prophet gave permission for his Companions to emigrate
			to Madinah to avoid further persecution from the Quraysh,
			Abdullah ibn Jahsh was the second to leave, preceded only by Abu
			Salamah. Emigrating was not a new experience for Abdullah. He and
			some members of his immediate family had migrated before to
			Abyssinia. This time, however, his migration was on a far bigger
			scale. His family and relatives--men, women and children,
			migrated with him. In fact, his whole clan had become Muslims and
			accompanied him.
		</p>
		<p>
			There was an air of desolation as they left Makkah. Their homes
			appeared sad and depressed as if no one had lived there before.
			No sound of conversation emanated from behind those silent walls.
		</p>
		<p>
			Abdullah's clan were not long gone when the alerted Quraysh
			leaders came out and made the rounds of the districts in Makkah
			to find out which Muslims had left and who had remained. Among
			these leaders were Abu Jahl and Utbah ibn Rabiah. Utah looked at
			the houses of the Banu Jahsh through which the dusty winds were
			blowing. He banged on the doors and shouted:
		</p>
		<p>
			"The houses of the Banu Jahsh have become empty and are weeping
			for its occupants."  "Who were these people anyway," said Abu
			Jahl derisively, "that houses should weep for them." He then laid
			claim to the house of Abdullah ibn Jahsh. It was the most
			beautiful and expensive of the houses. He began to dispose freely
			of its contents as a king would share out his possessions .
		</p>
		<p>
			Later, when Abdullah ibn Jahsh heard what Abu Jahl had done to
			his house, he mentioned it to the Prophet, peace be upon him, who
			said:
		</p>
		<p>
			"Aren't you satisfied, O Abdullah, with what God has given you
			instead, a house in Paradise?"
		</p>
		<p>
			"Yes, messenger of God," he replied, and became at peace with
			himself and completely satisfied.
		</p>
		<p>
			Abdullah ibn Jahsh had scarcely settled down in Madinah when he
			had to undergo one of the most testing experiences. He had just
			begun to taste something of the good and restful life under the
			sponsorship of the Ansar--after going through persecution at the
			hands of the Quraysh--when he had to be exposed to the severest
			test he had ever known in his life and carry out the most
			difficult assignment since he became a Muslim.
		</p>
		<p>
			The Prophet, peace and blessings of God be on him, commissioned
			eight of his Companions to carry out the first military
			assignment in Islam. Among them were Abdullah ibn Jahsh and Sad
			ibn Abi Waqqas.
		</p>
		<p>
			"I appoint as your Commander the one who can best bear hunger and
			thirst," said the Prophet and gave the standard to Abdullah ibn
			Jahsh. He was thus the first to be made amir over a contingent of
			believers.
		</p>
		<p>
			The Prophet gave him precise instructions on the route he should
			take on the expedition and gave him a letter. He commanded
			Abdullah to read the letter only after two days' travel.
		</p>
		<p>
			After the expedition had been on its way for two days, Abdullah
			looked at the contents of the letter. It said, "When you have
			read this letter, press on until you come to a place called
			Nakhlah between Taif and Makkah. From there observe the Quraysh
			and gather whatever information you can on them for us."
		</p>
		<p>
			"At your command, O Prophet of God," exclaimed Abdullah as he
			finished reading the letter. Then he spoke to his colleagues:
		</p>
		<p>
			"The Prophet has commanded me to proceed to Nakhlah to observe
			the Quraysh and gather information on them for him. He has also
			commanded me not to go further with anyone of you who is against
			the purpose of this expedition. So whoever desires martyrdom and
			is in total agreement with this expedition can accompany me.
			Whoever is not in agreement, may turn back without blame. "
		</p>
		<p>
			"At your command, O messenger of Allah," they all responded. "We
			shall go with you, Abdullah, wherever the Prophet of God has
			commanded."
		</p>
		<p>
			The group continued until they reached Nakhlah and began to move
			along the mountain passes seeking information on Quraysh
			movements. While they were thus engaged, they saw in the distance
			a Quraysh caravan. There were four men in the caravan--Amr ibn
			al-Hadrami, Hukm ibn Kaysan, Uthman ibn Abdullah and his brother
			Mughirah. They were carrying merchandise for the Quraysh--skins,
			raisins and other usual Quraysh stock in trade.
		</p>
		<p>
			The Sahabah conferred together. It was the last day of the sacred
			months. "If we were to kill them," they agreed, "we would have
			killed them in the inviolable months. To do so would be to
			violate the sacredness of this month and expose ourselves to the
			wrath of all Arabs. If we leave them alone for a day so that the
			month will be completed, they would have entered the inviolable
			precincts of Makkah and thus be secure from us."
		</p>
		<p>
			They continued consulting until finally they agreed to pounce on
			the caravan and take whatever merchandise they could as booty.
			Before long, two of the men were captured and one was killed; the
			fourth escaped.
		</p>
		<p>
			Abdullah ibn Jahsh and his men took the two prisoners and the
			caravan on to Madinah. They went to the Prophet, peace be upon
			him, and informed him about what they had done. The Prophet was
			greatly upset and strongly condemned their action.
		</p>
		<p>
			"By God, I did not command you to fight. I only commanded you to
			gather information on the Quraysh and observe their movements."
			He granted a reprieve to the two prisoners and he left the
			caravan and did not take a single item from it.
		</p>
		<p>
			Abdullah ibn Jahsh and his men then knew that they had fallen
			into disgrace and felt certain that they were ruined because of
			their disobeying the command of the Prophet. They began to feel
			the pressure as their Muslim brothers censured them and avoided
			them whenever they passed one another. And they would say, "These
			went against the command of the Prophet."
		</p>
		<p>
			Their discomfiture grew when they learnt that the Quraysh had
			taken the incident as a means to discredit the Prophet and
			denounce him among the tribes. The Quraysh were saying: "Muhammad
			has defiled the sacred month. He has shed blood in it, plundered
			wealth and captured men."
		</p>
		<p>
			Imagine the extent of the sadness felt by Abdullah ibn Jahsh and
			his men at what had happened, more so because of the acute
			embarrassment they had caused the Prophet.
		</p>
		<p>
			They were sorely tormented and the agony weighed heavily on them.
			Then came the good news that Allah--Glorified be He--was pleased
			with what they had done and had sent down revelation to His
			Prophet about this matter. Imagine their happiness! People came
			and embraced them, congratulating them on the good news and
			reciting to them what had been revealed in the glorious Quran
			about their action.
		</p>
		<p>
			"They ask you about fighting in the sacred month. Say: Fighting
			therein is an enormity as well as preventing (people) from the
			path of God and disbelief in Him. Expelling people from the
			Masjid al Haram is a greater sin in the eyes of God. Moreover,
			persecution is greater than killing." (Surah al-Baqarah 2: 212).
		</p>
		<p>
			When these blessed verses were revealed, the Prophet's mind was
			eased. He took the caravan and ransomed the prisoners. He became
			pleased with Abdullah ibn Jahsh and his men. Their expedition was
			certainly a major event in the early life of the Muslim community
			. . .
		</p>
		<p>
			The Battle of Badr followed. Abdullah ibn Jahsh fought in it and
			was put to a great test, but a test to which his faith was equal.
		</p>
		<p>
			Then came the Battle of Uhud. There is an unforgettable story
			involving Abdullah ibn Jahsh and his friend Sad ibn Abi Waqqas
			concerning an incident that took place during the Battle of Uhud.
			Let us leave Sad to tell the story:
		</p>
		<p>
			During the battle, Abdullah came to me and said, "Aren't you
			making a dua to God?'
		</p>
		<p>
			"Yes," said I. So we moved aside and I prayed, "O Lord, when I
			meet the enemy, let me meet a man of enormous strength and fury.
			Then grant me victory over him that I might kill him and acquire
			spoils from him." To this my prayer, Abdullah said Ameen and then
			he prayed:
		</p>
		<p>
			"Let me meet a man of great standing and enormous fury. I shall
			fight him for Your sake, O Lord, and he shall fight me. He shall
			take me and cut off my nose and ears and when I meet You on the
			morrow You will say, "For what were your nose and ear cut off?"
			And I would reply, "For Your sake and for the sake of Your
			Prophet." And then You would say, "You have spoken the truth . .
			." Sad continues the story:
		</p>
		<p>
			The prayer of Abdullah ibn Jahsh was better than mine. I saw him
			at the end of the day. He was killed and mutilated and in fact
			his nose and his ear were hung on a tree with a thread.  God
			responded to the prayer of Abdullah ibn Jahsh and blessed him
			with martyrdom as He blessed his uncle, the Leader of Martyrs,
			Hamzah ibn Abdulmuttalib. The noble Prophet buried them together
			in a single grave. His pure tears watered the earth anointed with
			the fragrance of martyrdom.

	<biography name="Muadh ibn Jabal">
		<p>
			Muadh ibn Jabal was a young man growing up in Yathrib as the
			light of guidance and truth began to spread over the Arabian
			peninsula. He was a handsome and imposing character with black
			eyes and curly hair and immediately impressed whoever he met. He
			was already distinguished for the sharpness of his intelligence
			among young men of his own age.
		</p>
		<p>
			The young Muadh became a Muslim at the hands of Musab ibn Umayr,
			the daiy (missionary) whom the Prophet had sent to Yathrib before
			the hijrah. Muadh was among the seventy-two Yathribites who
			journeyed to Makkah, one year before the hijrah, and met the
			Prophet at his house and later again in the valley of Mina,
			outside Makkah, at Aqabah. Here the famous second Aqabah Pledge
			was made at which the new Muslims of Yathrib, including some
			women, vowed to support and defend the Prophet at any cost. Muadh
			was among those who enthusiastically clasped the hands of the
			blessed Prophet then and pledged allegiance to him.
		</p>
		<p>
			As soon as Muadh returned to Madinah from Makkah, he and a few
			others of his age formed a group to remove and destroy idols from
			the houses of the mushrikeen in Yathrib. One of the effects of
			this campaign was that a prominent man of the city, Amr ibn
			al-Jumuh, became a Muslim.
		</p>
		<p>
			When the noble Prophet reached Madinah, Muadh ibn Jabal stayed in
			his company as much as possible. He studied the Quran and the
			laws of Islam until he became one of the most well-versed of all
			the companions in the religion of Islam.
		</p>
		<p>
			Wherever Muadh went, people would refer to him for legal
			judgments on matters over which they differed. This is not
			strange since he was brought up in the school of the Prophet
			himself and learnt as much as he could from him. He was the best
			pupil of the best teacher. His knowledge bore the stamp of
			authenticity. The best certificate that he could have received
			came from the Prophet himself when he said: "The most
			knowledgeable of my ummah in matters of Halal and haram is Muadh
			ibn Jabal."
		</p>
		<p>
			One of the greatest of Muadhs contributions to the ummah of
			Muhammad was that he was one of the group of six who collected
			the Quran during the lifetime of the Prophet, peace be upon him.
			Whenever a group of companions met and Muadh was among them, they
			would look at him with awe and respect on account of his
			knowledge. The Prophet and his two Khalitahs after him placed
			this unique gift and power in the service of Islam .
		</p>
		<p>
			After the liberation of Makkah, the Quraysh became Muslims en
			masse. The Prophet immediately saw the need of the new Muslims
			for teachers to instruct them in the fundamentals of Islam and to
			make them truly understand the spirit and letter of its laws. He
			appointed Attab ibn Usay as his deputy in Makkah and he asked
			Muadh ibn Jabal to stay with him and teach people the Quran and
			instruct them in the religion.
		</p>
		<p>
			Sometime after the Prophet had returned to Madinah, messengers of
			the kings of Yemen came to him announcing that they and the
			people of Yemen had become Muslims. They requested that some
			teachers should be with them to teach Islam to the people. For
			this task the Prophet commissioned a group of competent duat
			(missionaries) and made Muadh ibn Jabal their amir. He then put
			the following question to Muadh:
		</p>
		<p>
			"According to what will you judge?"
		</p>
		<p>
			"According to the Book of God," replied Muadh.
		</p>
		<p>
			"And if you find nothing therein?"
		</p>
		<p>
			"According to the Sunnah of the Prophet of God."
		</p>
		<p>
			"And if you find nothing therein?"
		</p>
		<p>
			"Then I will exert myself (exercise ijtihad) to form my own
			judgment."
		</p>
		<p>
			The Prophet was pleased with this reply and said: "Praise be to
			God Who has guided the messenger of the Prophet to that which
			pleases the Prophet."
		</p>
		<p>
			The Prophet personally bade farewell to this mission of guidance
			and light and walked for some distance alongside Muadh as he rode
			out of the city. Finally he said to him:
		</p>
		<p>
			"O Muadh, perhaps you shall not meet me again after this year.
			Perhaps when you return you shall see only my mosque and my
			grave."  Muadh wept. Those with him wept too. A feeling of
			sadness and desolation overtook him as he parted from his beloved
			Prophet, peace and blessings of God be on him.
		</p>
		<p>
			The Prophet's premonition was correct. The eyes of Muadh never
			beheld the Prophet after that moment. The Prophet died before
			Muadh returned from the Yemen. There is no doubt that Muadh wept
			when he returned to Madinah and found there was no longer the
			blessed company of the Prophet.
		</p>
		<p>
			During the caliphate of Umar, Muadh was sent to the Banu Kilab to
			apportion their stipends and to distribute the sadaqah of their
			richer folk among the poor. When he had done his duty, he
			returned to his wife with his saddle blanket around his neck,
			empty handed, and she asked him:
		</p>
		<p>
			"Where are the gifts which commissioners return with for their
			families?"  "I had an alert Supervisor who was checking over me,"
			he replied.  "You were a trusted person with the messenger of God
			and with Abu Bakr. Then Umar came and he sent a supervisor with
			you to check on you!' she exclaimed. She went on to talk about
			this to the women of Umar's household and complained to them
			about it. The complaint eventually reached Umar, so he summoned
			Muadh and said:
		</p>
		<p>
			"Did I send a supervisor with you to check on you?"
		</p>
		<p>
			"No, Amir al-Mumineen," he said, "But that was the only reason I
			could find to give her." Umar laughed and then gave him a gift,
			saying, "I hope this pleases you."
		</p>
		<p>
			Also during the caliphate of Umar, the governor of Syria, Yazid
			ibn Abi Sufyan sent a message saying:
		</p>
		<p>
			"O Amir al-Mumineen! The people of Syria are many. They fill the
			towns. They need people to teach them the Quran and instruct them
			in the religion."
		</p>
		<p>
			Umar thereupon summoned five persons who had collected the Quran
			in the lifetime of the Prophet, peace be upon him. They were
			Muadh ibn Jabal, Ubadah ibn asSamit, Abu Ayyub al-Ansari, Ubayy
			ibn Kab and Abu adDardaa. He said to them:
		</p>
		<p>
			"Your brothers in Syria have asked me to help them by sending
			those who can teach them the Quran and instruct them in the
			religion. Please appoint three among you for this task and may
			God bless you. I can select three of you myself if you do not
			want to put the matter to the vote."
		</p>
		<p>
			"Why should we vote?" they asked. "Abu Ayyub is quite old and
			Ubayy is a sick man. That leaves three of us."	"All three of you
			go to Homs first of all. If you are satisfied with the condition
			of the people there, one of you should stay there, another should
			go to Damascus and the other to Palestine."
		</p>
		<p>
			So it was that Ubadah ibn as-Samit was left at Homs, Abu
			ad-Dardaa went to Damascus and Muadh went to Palestine. There
			Muadh fell ill with an infectious disease. As he was near to
			death, he turned in the direction of the Kabah and repeated this
			refrain: "Welcome Death, Welcome. A visitor has come after a long
			absence . . ." And looking up to heaven, he said: "O Lord, You
			know that I did not desire the world and to prolong my stay in it
			. . . O Lord, accept my soul with goodness as you would accept a
			believing soul..."
		</p>
		<p>
			He then passed away, far from his family and his clan, a daiy in
			the service of God and a muhajir in His path.
		</p>
	</biography>
	<biography name="Thumamah ibn Uthal">
		<p>
			In the sixth year after the hijrah, the Prophet, may the
			blessings of God be on him, decided to expand the scope of his
			mission. He sent eight letters to rulers in the Arabian peninsula
			and surrounding areas inviting them to Islam. One of these rulers
			was Thumamah ibn Uthal.
		</p>
		<p>
			Thumamah was one of the most powerful Arab rulers in pre-Quranic
			times. This is not surprising since he was a chieftain of the
			Banu Hanifah and one of the rulers of al-Yamamah whose word no
			one dared to challenge or disobey.
		</p>
		<p>
			When Thumamah received the Prophet's letter, he was consumed by
			anger and rejected it. He refused to listen to the invitation of
			Truth and goodness. More than that, he felt a strong desire to go
			and kill the Prophet and bury his mission with him.
		</p>
		<p>
			Thumamah waited and waited for a convenient time to carry out his
			design against the Prophet until eventually forgetfulness caused
			him to lose interest. One of his uncles, however, reminded him of
			his plan, praising what he intended to do.
		</p>
		<p>
			In the pursuit of his evil design against the Prophet, Thumamah
			met and killed a group of the Prophet's companions. The Prophet
			thereupon declared him a wanted man who could lawfully be killed
			on sight. Not long afterwards, Thumamah decided to perform umrah.
			He wanted to perform tawaf around the Kabah and sacrifice to the
			idols there. So he left al-Yamamah for Makkah. As he was passing
			near Madinah, an incident took place which he had not
			anticipated.
		</p>
		<p>
			Groups of Muslims were patrolling the districts of Madinah and
			outlying areas on the lookout for any strangers or anyone intent
			on causing trouble. One of these groups came upon Thumamah and
			apprehended him but they did not know who he was. They took him
			to Madinah and tied him to one of the columns in the mosque. They
			waited for the Prophet himself to question the man and decide
			what should be done with him.
		</p>
		<p>
			When the Prophet was about to enter the mosque, he saw Thumamah
			and asked his companions, 'Do you know whom you have taken?"
		</p>
		<p>
			"No, messenger of God," they replied.
		</p>
		<p>
			"This is Thumamah ibn Uthal al-Hanafi," he said. "You have done
			well in capturing him."
		</p>
		<p>
			The Prophet then returned home to his family and said, "Get what
			food you can and send it to Thumamah ibn Uthal." He then ordered
			his camel to be milked for him. All this was done before he met
			Thumamah or had spoken to him.
		</p>
		<p>
			The Prophet then approached Thumamah hoping to encourage him to
			become a Muslim. "What do you have to say for yourself?" he
			asked.
		</p>
		<p>
			"If you want to kill in reprisal," Thumamah replied, "you can
			have someone of noble blood to kill. If, out of your bounty, you
			want to forgive, I shall be grateful. If you want money in
			compensation, I shall give you whatever amount you ask."
		</p>
		<p>
			The Prophet then left him for two days, but still personally sent
			him food and drink and milk from his camel. The Prophet went back
			to him and asked, "What do you have to say for yourself?"
			Thumamah repeated what he had said the day before. The Prophet
			then left and came back to him the following day. "What do you
			have to say for yourself?" he asked again and Thumamah repeated
			what he had said once more. Then the Prophet turned to his
			companions and said, "Set him free."
		</p>
		<p>
			Thumamah left the mosque of the Prophet and rode until he came to
			a palm grove on the outskirts of Madinah near al-Baqi' (a place
			of luxuriant vegetation which later became a cemetery for many of
			the Prophet's companions). He watered his camel and washed
			himself well. Then he turned back and made his way to the
			Prophet's mosque. There, he stood before a congregation of
			Muslims and said: "I bear witness that there is no god but Allah
			and I bear witness that Muhammad is His servant and His
			messenger." He then went to the Prophet, upon whom be peace, and
			said: "O Muhammad, by God, there was never on this earth a face
			more detestable than yours. Now, yours is the dearest face of all
			to me."  "I have killed some of your men," he continued, "I am at
			your mercy. What will you have done to me?"
		</p>
		<p>
			"There is now no blame on you, Thumamah," replied the Prophet.
			"Becoming a Muslim obliterates past actions and marks a new
			beginning."
		</p>
		<p>
			Thumamah was greatly relieved. His face showed his surprise and
			joy and he vowed, "By God, I shall place my whole self, my sword,
			and whoever is with me at your service and at the service of your
			religion."
		</p>
		<p>
			"O Rasulullah," he went on, "when your horsemen captured me I was
			on my way to perform umrah. What do you think I should do now?"
		</p>
		<p>
			"Go ahead and perform your umrah," replied the Prophet, "but
			perform it according to the laws of God and His messenger." The
			Prophet then taught him how to perform umrah according to Islamic
			rules.
		</p>
		<p>
			Thumamah left to fulfill his intention. When he reached the
			valley of Makkah, he began shouting in a loud, resonant voice:
		</p>
		<p>
			"Labbayk Allahumma labbayk. Labbayka Laa shareeka Laka labbayk.
			Innal hamda wan ni'mata Laka wall mulk. Laa shareeka Lak. (Here I
			am at Your command O Lord, Here I am. Here I am. No partner have
			You. Here I am. Praise, bounty and Dominion belong to You. No
			partner have You.")
		</p>
		<p>
			He was thus the first Muslim on the face of the earth to enter
			Makkah reciting the talbiyah.
		</p>
		<p>
			The Quraysh heard the sound of the talbiyah and felt both anger
			and alarm. With drawn swords, they set out towards the voice to
			punish the one who had thus assaulted their preserve. As they
			came closer to him, Thumamah raised his voice even higher while
			reciting the talbiyah and looked upon them with pride and
			defiance. One of the Quraysh young men was particularly incensed
			and was about to shoot Thumamah with an arrow when the others
			grabbed his hand and shouted:
		</p>
		<p>
			"Woe to you! Do you know who this is? He is Thumamah ibn Uthal,
			ruler of al-Yamamah. By God, if you should harm him, his people
			would cut our supplies, with dire consequences for us."
		</p>
		<p>
			Swords were replaced in their scabbards as the Quraysh went up to
			Thumamah and said:
		</p>
		<p>
			"What's wrong with you, Thumamah? Have you given in and abandoned
			your religion and the religion of your forefathers?"
		</p>
		<p>
			"I have not given in," he replied, "but I have decided to follow
			the best religion. I follow the religion of Muhammad. "
		</p>
		<p>
			He then went on: "I swear to you by the Lord of this House that
			after my return to al-Yamamah, no grain of wheat or any of its
			produce shall reach you until you follow Muhammad."
		</p>
		<p>
			Under the watchful eyes of the Quraysh, Thumamah performed umrah
			as the Prophet, peace be upon him, had instructed him. He
			dedicated his sacrifice to God alone.
		</p>
		<p>
			Thumamah returned to his land and ordered his people to withhold
			supplies from the Quraysh. The boycott gradually began to have
			effect and became more and more stringent. Prices began to rise.
			Hunger began to bite and there was even fear of death among the
			Quraysh. Thereupon, they wrote to the Prophet, saying:
		</p>
		<p>
			"Our agreement with you (the treaty of Hudaybiyyah) is that you
			should maintain the bonds of kinship but you have gone against
			that. You have cut the bonds of kinship. You have killed and
			caused death through hunger. Thumamah ibn Uthal has cut our
			supplies and inflicted harm on us. Perhaps you would see fit to
			instruct him to resume sending us what we need."
		</p>
		<p>
			The Prophet immediately sent a messenger instructing Thumamah to
			lift the boycott and resume supplies to the Quraysh. This
			Thumamah did.
		</p>
		<p>
			Thumamah spent the rest of his life in the service of his
			religion, abiding by the undertaking he had given to the Prophet.
			When the Prophet died, many Arabs began leaving the religion of
			God in great numbers. Musaylamah, the impostor, began calling the
			Banu Hanifah to believe in him as a Prophet. Thumamah confronted
			him and said to his people:
		</p>
		<p>
			"O Banu Hanifah, beware of this grievous matter. There is no
			light or guidance in it. By God, it will only bring distress and
			suffering to whoever joins this movement and misfortune even to
			those who do not join.
		</p>
		<p>
			"O Banu Hanifah, two prophets do not come at the same time and
			there shall be no Prophet after Muhammad and no Prophet to share
			in his mission."

			He then read out to them the following verses of the Quran: "Ha
			Mim. The revelation of this Book is from God the Almighty, the
			Knowing. He forgives sins and accepts repentance. He is severe in
			punishment and has a long reach. There is no god except Him. To
			Him is the journey's end." (Surah Ghafir; verses 1-3).
		</p>
		<p>
			"Can you compare these words of God with the uttering of
			Musaylamah?" he asked.
		</p>
		<p>
			He then gathered together all those who had remained in Islam and
			began to wage a jihad against the apostates and to make the words
			of God supreme. The loyal Muslims of Banu Hanifah needed
			additional help to stand against the armies of Musaylamah. Their
			arduous task was completed by the forces dispatched by Abu Bakr
			but at the cost of many a Muslim life.

			People are made up of basic "metals" or qualities. The best of
			them in Jahiliyyah are the best of them in Islam, according to a
			hadith of the Prophet.
		</p>
		<p>
			Here are two pictures of a noble companion--one during his life
			in Jahiliyyah and the other after he became a Muslim .
		</p>
		<p>
			In Jahiliyyah, this Sahabi was known as Zayd al-Khayl. When he
			became a Muslim, the Prophet renamed him Zayd al-Khayr.
		</p>
		<p>
			The tribe of Aamir were afflicted one year by a severe drought
			which destroyed crops and vegetation and caused livestock to
			perish. So bad was it that one man left the tribe with his family
			and went to Hira. There he left his family with the words, "Wait
			for me here till I return to you." He swore to himself not to
			return to them until he earned some money for them or died in the
			process.
		</p>
		<p>
			The man took some provisions with him and walked all day in
			search of something for his family. At nightfall, he found
			himself in front of a tent. Nearby a horse was tethered and he
			said to himself:
		</p>
		<p>
			"This is the first booty." He went to the horse, untied it and
			was about to mount it when a voice called out to him:
		</p>
		<p>
			"Leave it and take your life as booty." He hastily abandoned the
			horse.
		</p>
		<p>
			For seven days he walked until he reached a place where there was
			a pasture for camels. Nearby was an enormous tent with a leather
			dome, signs of great riches and wealth.
		</p>
		<p>
			The man said to himself: "Doubtless this pasture has camels and
			doubtless this tent has occupants." The sun was about to set. The
			man looked inside the tent and saw a very old man in the center.
			He sat down behind the old man without the latter realizing his
			presence.
		</p>
		<p>
			The sun soon set. A horseman, imposing and well built,
			approached. He rode his mount erect and tall. Two male servants
			accompanied him, one on his right and the other on his left. With
			him were almost a hundred she-camels and in front of them a huge
			male camel. Clearly he was a well endowed man. To one of the
			servants he said, pointing to a fat camel:
		</p>
		<p>
			"Milk this and give the old man a drink." The shaykh drank one or
			two mouthfuls from the full vessel which was brought to him and
			left it. The wanderer went up to it stealthily and drank all the
			milk in it. The servant returned, took the vessel and said:
		</p>
		<p>
			"Master, he has drunk it all." The horseman was happy and ordered
			another camel to be milked. The old man drank only one mouthful
			and the wanderer drank half of what was left so as not to arouse
			the suspicion of the horseman. The horseman then ordered his
			second servant to kill a sheep. Some of it was grilled and the
			horseman fed the shaykh until he was satisfied. He and the two
			servants then ate. After this, they all slept soundly; their
			snoring filled the tent.
		</p>
		<p>
			The wanderer then went to the he-camel, untied and mounted it. He
			rode off and the she camels followed. He rode throughout the
			night. At daybreak he looked around in every direction but did
			not see anyone following him. He pushed on until the sun was high
			in the sky. He looked around and suddenly saw something like an
			eagle or a big bird in the distance coming towards him. It
			quickly gained on him and soon he saw that it was the horseman on
			his horse.
		</p>
		<p>
			The wanderer dismounted and tied the he-camel. He took out an
			arrow and placed it in his bow and stood in front of the other
			camels. The horseman stopped at a distance and shouted:
		</p>
		<p>
			"Untie the camel." The man refused saying how he had left behind
			him a hungry family in Hira and how he had sworn not to return
			unless he had money or died in the process
		</p>
		<p>
			"You are dead if you do not untie the camel," said the horseman.
			The wanderer again refused to do so. The horseman threatened him
			once more and said:
		</p>
		<p>
			"Hold out the reins of the camel. There are three knots in it.
			Tell me in which of them you want me to place my arrow." The man
			pointed to the middle knot and the horseman lodged an arrow right
			in the center as if he had neatly placed it there with his hand.
			He did the same with the second and third knots. At that, the man
			quietly returned his own arrow to his quiver and gave himself up.
			The horseman took away his sword and his bow and said to him:
		</p>
		<p>
			"Ride behind me." The man expected the worst fate to befall him
			now. He was at the complete mercy of the horseman who said:
		</p>
		<p>
			"Do you think I will cause you harm when you have shared with
			Muhalhil (the old man, his father) his drink and his food last
			night?"
		</p>
		<p>
			When the man heard the name Muhalhil, he was astonished and
			asked: "Are you Zayd al-Khayl?"
		</p>
		<p>
			"Yes," said the horseman.
		</p>
		<p>
			"Be the best captor," pleaded the man.
		</p>
		<p>
			"Don't worry," replied Zayd al-Khayl calmly. "If these camels
			were mine, I would give them to you. But they belong to one of my
			sisters. But stay some days with me. I am about to make a raid."
		</p>
		<p>
			Three days later he raided the Banu Numayr and captured about a
			hundred camels, as booty. He gave them all to the man and sent
			some men with him as guards until he reached his family in Hira.
		</p>
		<p>
			The above is a story of Zayd al-Khayl as he was in Jahiliyyah
			recounted by the historian ash-Shaybani. The books of Siyar give
			another picture of Zayd al-Khayl as he was in Islam . . .
		</p>
		<p>
			When Zayd al-Khayr heard the news of the Prophet, peace be upon
			him, he made some of his own enquiries and then decided to go to
			Madinah to meet the Prophet. With him was a big delegation of his
			people among whom were Zurr ibn Sudoos, Malik ibn Jubayr, Aamir
			ibn Duwayn and others.
		</p>
		<p>
			When they reached Madinah, they went straight to the Prophet's
			Mosque and tethered their mounts at its door. It happened that as
			they entered, the Prophet was on the mimbar addressing the
			Muslims. His speech aroused Zayd and his delegation and they were
			also astonished by the rapt attention of the Muslims and the
			effect of the Prophet's words on them. The Prophet was saying:
		</p>
		<p>
			"I am better for you than al-Uzza (one of the main idols of the
			Arabs in Jahiliyyah) and everything else that you worship. I am
			better for you than the black camel which you worship besides
			God."
		</p>
		<p>
			The Prophet's words had two different effects on Zayd al-Khayl
			and those with him. Some of them responded positively to the
			Truth and accepted it. Some turned away and rejected it. One of
			the latter was Zurr ibn Sudoos. When he saw the devotion of the
			believers to Muhammad, both envy and fear filled his heart and he
			said to those with him:
		</p>
		<p>
			"I see a man who shall certainly captivate all Arabs and bring
			them under his sway. I shall not let him control me ever." He
			then headed towards Syria where it is said he shaved his head (as
			was the practice of some monks) and became a Christian.
		</p>
		<p>
			The reaction of Zayd and others was different. When the Prophet
			had finished speaking, Zayd stood up, tall and impressive-looking
			in the midst of the Muslims and said in a loud and clear voice:
		</p>
		<p>
			"O Muhammad, I testify that there is no god but Allah and that
			you are the messenger of Allah."
		</p>
		<p>
			The Prophet came up to him and asked, "Who are you"
		</p>
		<p>
			"I am Zayd al-Khayl the son of Muhalhil."
		</p>
		<p>
			"From now on you are Zayd al-Khayr instead, not Zayd al-Khayl,"
			said the Prophet. "Praise be to God Who has brought you from the
			hills and dales of your native land and softened your heart
			towards Islam." Thereafter he was known as Zayd al-Khayr (Zayd
			the Good).
		</p>
		<p>
			The Prophet then took him to his house. With them were Umar ibn
			al-Khattab and some other Companions. The Prophet gave him a
			cushion to sit on but he felt very uncomfortable to recline thus
			in the presence of the Prophet and he returned the cushion. The
			Prophet handed it back to him and he returned it to him. This
			happened three times. Eventually, when they were all seated, the
			Prophet said to Zayd al-Khayr:
		</p>
		<p>
			"O Zayd, no man has ever been described to me and when I see him
			he does not fit the description at all except you. You have two
			characteristics which are pleasing to God and His Prophet."
		</p>
		<p>
			"What are they?" asked Zayd.
		</p>
		<p>
			"Perseverance and sagacity," replied the Prophet.
		</p>
		<p>
			"Praise be to God," said Zayd, "Who has given me what He and His
			Prophet like." He then turned directly to the Prophet and said: 
			"Give me, O messenger of God, three hundred horsemen and I
			promise you that I will secure Byzantine territory with them." 
			The Prophet praised his fervor and said, "What manner of man are
			you!"
		</p>
		<p>
			During this visit, all those who stayed with Zayd became Muslims.
			They then desired to return to their homes in Najd and the
			Prophet bade them farewell. The great desire of Zayd al-Khayr to
			work and fight for the cause of Islam, however was not to be
			realized.
		</p>
		<p>
			In Madinah al-Munawwarah at that time there was an epidemic of
			fever and Zayd al-Khayr succumbed to it and said to those with
			him: "Take me away from the land of Qays. I have the fever of
			small pox. By God, I shall not fight as a Muslim before I meet
			Allah, the Mighty the Great."
		</p>
		<p>
			Zayd took the road to his people in Najd in spite of the fact
			that the fever became more and more intense and slowed him down.
			He hoped at least to get back to his people and that they would
			become Muslims, through God's grace, at his hands. He struggled
			to overcome the fever but it got the better of him and he
			breathed his last on the way before reaching Najd. Between his
			acceptance of Islam and his death, however, there was no time for
			him to have fallen into sin.

	<biography name="Barakah">
		<p>
			We do not know precisely how the young Abyssinian girl ended up
			for sale in Makkah. We do not know her 'roots', who her mother
			was, or her father or her ancestors. There were many like her,
			boys and girls, Arabs and non-Arabs, who were captured and
			brought to the slave market of the city to be sold.
		</p>
		<p>
			A terrible fate awaited some who ended up in the hands of cruel
			masters or mistresses who exploited their labor to the full and
			treated them with the utmost harsh ness.
		</p>
		<p>
			A few in that inhuman environment were rather more fortunate.
			They were taken into the homes of more gentle and caring people.
		</p>
		<p>
			Barakah, the young Abyssinian girl, was one of the more fortunate
			ones. She was saved by the generous and kind Abdullah, the son of
			Abd al-Muttalib. 'She became the only servant in his household
			and when he was married, to the lady Aminah, she looked after her
			affairs as well.
		</p>
		<p>
			Two weeks after the couple were married, according to Barakah,
			Abdullah's father came to their house and instructed his son to
			go with a trading caravan that was leaving for Syria. Aminah was
			deeply distressed and cried:
		</p>
		<p>
			"How strange! How strange! How can my husband go on a trading
			journey to Syria while I am yet a bride and the traces of henna
			are still on my hands."
		</p>
		<p>
			Abdullah's departure was heartbreaking. In her anguish, Aminah
			fainted. Soon after he left, Barakah said: "When I saw Aminah
			unconscious, I shouted in distress and pain: 'O my lady!' Aminah
			opened her eyes and looked at me with tears streaming down her
			face. Suppressing a groan she said: "Take me to bed, Barakah."
		</p>
		<p>
			"Aminah stayed bedridden for a long time. She spoke to no one.
			Neither did she look at anyone who visited her except Abd
			al-Muttalib, that noble and gentle old man. "Two months after the
			departure of Abdullah, Aminah called me at dawn one morning and,
			her face beaming with joy, she said to me:
		</p>
		<p>
			"O Barakah! I have seen a strange dream."  "Something good, my
			lady," I said.
		</p>
		<p>
			"I saw lights coming from my abdomen lighting up the
		</p>
		<p>
			mountains, the hills and the valleys around Makkah."  "Do you
			feel pregnant, my lady?"
		</p>
		<p>
			"Yes, Barakah," she replied. "But I do not feel any discomfort as
			other women feel."  "You shall give birth to a blessed child who
			will bring goodness," I said.
		</p>
		<p>
			So long as Abdullah was away, Aminah remained sad and
			melancholic. Barakah stayed at her side trying to comfort her and
			make her cheerful by talking to her and relating stories. Aminah
			however became even more distressed when Abd al-Muttalib came and
			told her she had to leave her home and go to the mountains as
			other Makkans had done because of an impending attack on the city
			by the ruler of Yemen, someone called Abrahah. Aminah told him
			that she was too grief-striken and weak to leave for the
			mountains but insisted that Abrahah could never enter Makkah and
			destroy the Kabah because it was protected by the Lord. Abd
			al-Muttalib became very agitated but there was no sign of fear on
			Aminah's face. Her confidence that the Kabah would not be harmed
			was well-founded. Abrahah's army with an elephant in the vanguard
			was destroyed before it could enter Makkah.
		</p>
		<p>
			Day and night, Barakah stayed beside Aminah. She said: "I slept
			at the foot of her bed and heard her groans at night as she
			called for her absent husband. Her moans would awaken me and I
			would try to comfort her and give her courage."
		</p>
		<p>
			The first part of the caravan from Syria returned and was
			joyously welcomed by the trading families of Makkah. Barakah went
			secretly to the house of Abd al-Muttalib to find out about
			Abdullah but had no news of him. She went back to Aminah but did
			not tell her what she had seen or heard in order not to distress
			her. The entire caravan eventually returned but not with
			Abdullah.
		</p>
		<p>
			Later, Barakah was at Abd al-Muttalib's house when news came from
			Yathrib that Abdullah had died. She said:  "I screamed when I
			heard the news. I don't know what I did after that except that I
			ran to Aminah's house shouting, lamenting for the absent one who
			would never return, lamenting for the beloved one for whom we
			waited so long, lamenting for the most beautiful youth of Makkah,
			for Abdullah, the pride of the Quraysh.
		</p>
		<p>
			"When Aminah heard the painful news, she fainted and I stayed by
			her bedside while she was in a state between life and death.
			There was no one else but me in Aminah's house. I nursed her and
			looked after her during the day and through the long nights until
			she gave birth to her child, "Muhammad", on a night in which the
			heavens were resplendent with the light of God."
		</p>
		<p>
			When Muhammad was born, Barakah was the first to hold him in her
			arms. His grandfather came and took him to the Kabah and with all
			Makkah, celebrated his birth. Barakah stayed with Aminah while
			Muhammad was sent to the badiyah with the lady Halimah who looked
			after him in the bracing atmosphere of the open desert. At the
			end of five years, he was brought back to Makkah and Aminah
			received him with tenderness and love and Barakah welcomed him
			"with joy, longing and admiration".
		</p>
		<p>
			When Muhammad was six years old, his mother decided to visit the
			grave of her husband, Abdullah, in Yathrib. Both Barakah and Abd
			al-Muttalib tried to dissuade her. Aminah however was determined.
			So one morning they set off- Aminah, Muhammad and Barakah huddled
			together in a small hawdaj mounted on a large camel, part of a
			huge caravan that was going to Syria. In order to shield the
			tender child from any pain and worry, Aminah did not tell
			Muhammad that she was going to visit the grave of his father.
		</p>
		<p>
			The caravan went at a brisk pace. Barakah tried to console Aminah
			for her son's sake and much of the time the boy Muhammad slept
			with his arms around Barakah's neck.
		</p>
		<p>
			The caravan took ten days to reach Yathrib. The boy Muhammad was
			left with his maternal uncles of the Banu Najjar while Aminah
			went to visit the grave of Abdullah. Each day for a few weeks she
			stayed at the grave. She was consumed by grief.
		</p>
		<p>
			On the way back to Makkah, Aminah became seriously ill with
			fever. Halfway between Yathrib and Makkah, at a place called
			al-Abwa, they stopped. Aminah's health deteriorated rapidly. One
			pitch dark night, she was running a high temperature. The fever
			had got to her head and she called out to Barakah in a choking
			voice.
		</p>
		<p>
			Barakah related: "She whispered in my ear: 'O Barakah, I shall
			depart from this world shortly. I commend my son Muhammad to your
			care. He lost his father while he was in my abdomen. Here he is
			now, losing his mother under his very eyes. Be a mother to him,
			Barakah. And don't ever leave him.'
		</p>
		<p>
			"My heart was shattered and I began to sob and wail. The child
			was distressed by my wailing and began to weep. He threw himself
			into his mother's arms and held tightly onto her neck. She gave
			one last moan and then was forever silent."
		</p>
		<p>
			Barakah wept. She wept bitterly. With her own hands she dug a
			grave in the sand and buried Aminah, moistening the grave with
			whatever tears were left in her heart.	Barakah returned with the
			orphan child to Makkah and placed him in the care of his
			grandfather. She stayed at his house to look after him. When Abd
			al-Muttalib died two years later, she went with the child to the
			house of his uncle Abu Talib and continued to look after his
			needs until he was grown up and married the lady Khadijah.
		</p>
		<p>
			Barakah then stayed with Muhammad and Khadijah in a house
			belonging to Khadijah. "I never left him and he never left me,"
			she said. One day Muhammad, may Allah bless him and grant him
			peace, called out to her and said: "Ya Ummah!" (He always called
			her "Mother".)	"Now I am a married man, and you are still
			unmarried. What do you think if someone should come now and ask
			to marry you?"	Barakah looked at Muhammad and said:  "I shall
			never leave you. Does a mother abandon her son?"  Muhammad smiled
			and kissed her head. He looked at his wife Khadijah and said to
			her:  "This is Barakah. This is my mother after my own mother.
			She is the rest of my family."
		</p>
		<p>
			Barakah looked at the lady Khadijah who said to her: "Barakah,
			you have sacrificed your youth for the sake of Muhammad. Now he
			wants to pay back some of his obligations to you. For my sake and
			his, agree to be married before old age overtakes you."
		</p>
		<p>
			"Whom shall I marry, my lady?" asked Barakah. "There is here now
			Ubayd ibn Zayd from the Khazraj tribe of Yathrib. He has come to
			us seeking your hand in marriage. For my sake, don't refuse."
		</p>
		<p>
			Barakah agreed. She married Ubayd ibn Zayd and went with him to
			Yathrib. There she gave birth to a son whom she called Ayman and
			from that time onwards people called her "Umm Ayman" the mother
			of Ayman.
		</p>
		<p>
			Her marriage however did not last very long. Her husband died and
			she returned once more to Makkah to live with her "son" Muhammad
			in the house of the lady Khadijah. Living in the same household
			at the time were Ali ibn Abi Talib, Hind (Khadijah's daughter by
			her first husband), and Zayd ibn Harithah.
		</p>
		<p>
			Zayd was an Arab from the tribe of Kalb who was captured as a boy
			and brought to Makkah to be sold in the slave market. He was
			bought by Khadijah's nephew and put in her service. In Khadijah's
			household, Zayd became attached to Muhammad and devoted himself
			to his service. Their relationship was like that of a son to a
			father. Indeed when Zayd's father came to Makkah in search of
			him, Zayd was given the choice by Muhammad of either going with
			his father or staying with him. Zayd's reply to his father was:
		</p>
		<p>
			"I shall never leave this man. He has treated me nobly, as a
			father would treat his son. Not a single day have I felt that I
			am a slave. He has looked after me well. He is kind and loving
			towards me and strives for my enjoyment and happiness. He is the
			most noble of men and the greatest person in creation. How can I
			leave him and go with you?...I shall never leave him."
		</p>
		<p>
			Later, in public Muhammad proclaimed the freedom of Zayd.
			However, Zayd continued to live with him as part of his household
			and devoted himself to his service.
		</p>
		<p>
			When Muhammad was blessed with prophethood, Barakah and Zayd were
			among the first to believe in the message he proclaimed. They
			bore with the early Muslims the persecution which the Quraysh
			meted out to them.
		</p>
		<p>
			Barakah and Zayd performed invaluable services to the mission of
			the Prophet. They acted as part of an intelligence service
			exposing themselves to the persecution and punishment of the
			Quraysh and risking their lives to gain information on the plans
			and conspiracies of the mushrikin.
		</p>
		<p>
			One night the mushrikun blocked off the roads leading to the
			House of al-Arqam where the Prophet gathered his companions
			regularly to instruct them in the teachings of Islam. Barakah had
			some urgent information from Khadijah which had to be conveyed to
			the Prophet. She risked her life trying to reach the House of
			al-Arqam. When she arrived and conveyed the message to the
			Prophet, he smiled and said to her:
		</p>
		<p>
			"You are blessed, Umm Ayman. Surely you have a place in
			Paradise."  When Umm Ayman left, the Prophet looked at his
			companions and asked: "Should one of you desire to marry a woman
			from the people of Paradise, let him marry Umm Ayman."
		</p>
		<p>
			Ali the companions remained silent and did not utter a word. Umm
			Ayman was neither beautiful nor attractive. She was by now about
			fifty years old and looked rather frail. Zayd ibn al-Harithah
			however came forward and said:
		</p>
		<p>
			"Messenger of Allah, I shall marry Umm Ayman. By Allah, she is
			better than women who have grace and beauty."
		</p>
		<p>
			Zayd and Umm Ayman were married and were blessed with a son whom
			they named Usamah. The Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him
			peace, loved Usamah as his own son. Often he played with him,
			kissed him and fed him with his own hands. The Muslims would say:
			"He is the beloved son of the beloved." From an early age Usamah
			distinguished himself in the service of lslam, and was later
			given weighty responsibilities by the Prophet.
		</p>
		<p>
			When the Prophet migrated to Yathrib, henceforth to be known as
			al-Madinah, he left Umm Ayman behind in Makkah to look after
			certain special affairs in his household. Eventually she migrated
			to Madinah on her own. She made the long and difficult journey
			through the desert and mountainous terrain on foot. The heat was
			killing and sandstorms obscured the way but she persisted, borne
			along by her deep love and attachment for Muhammad, may God bless
			him and grant him peace. When she reached Madinah, her feet were
			sore and swollen and her face was covered with sand and dust.
		</p>
		<p>
			"Ya Umm Ayman! Ya Ummi! (O Umm Ayman! O my mother!) Indeed for
			you is a place in Paradise!" exclaimed the Prophet when he saw
			her. He wiped her face and eyes, massaged her feet and rubbed her
			shoulders with his kind and gentle hands.
		</p>
		<p>
			At Madinah, Umm Ayman played her full part in the affairs of the
			Muslims. At Uhud she distributed water to the thirsty and tended
			the wounded. She accompanied the Prophet on some expeditions, to
			Khaybar and Hunayn for example.
		</p>
		<p>
			Her son Ayman, a devoted companion of the Prophet was martyred at
			Hunayn in the eighth year after the Hijrah. Barakah's husband,
			Zayd, was killed at the Battle of Mutah in Syria after a lifetime
			of distinguished service to the Prophet and Islam. Barakah at
			this time was about seventy years old and spent much of her time
			at home. The Prophet, accompanied by Abu Bakr and Umar often
			visited her and asked:	"Ya Ummi! Are you well?" and she would
			reply:	"I am well, O Messenger of Allah so long as Islam is."
		</p>
		<p>
			After the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace, had
			died, Barakah would often be found with tears in her eyes. She
			was once asked, "Why are you crying?" and she replied:	"By
			Allah, I knew that the Messenger of Allah would die but I cry now
			because the revelation from on high has come to an end for us."
		</p>
		<p>
			Barakah was unique in that she was the only one who was so close
			to the Prophet throughout his life from birth till death. Her
			life was one of selfless service in the Prophet's household. She
			remained deeply devoted to the person of the noble, gentle and
			caring Prophet. Above all, her devotion to the religion of Islam
			was strong and unshakable. She died during the caliphate of
			Uthman. Her roots were unknown but her place in Paradise was
			assured.

			When he was barely ten years old, Umayr became a Muslim. Faith
			found in his tender heart a secure niche and penetrated deeply
			into his being. In spite of youthfulness, he would never delay in
			the performance of salat behind the noble Prophet. Often he would
			be found in the first row of worshippers, hoping for the thawab
			promised those who attend mosques early and sit in the foremost
			rows. His mother was particularly pleased whenever she saw him
			going to and coming from the mosque, sometimes with her husband
			and sometimes alone.
		</p>
		<p>
			Umayr's days passed in this fashion with no major disturbance to
			upset his calm and contentment. This idyllic state, however,
			could not last forever. Umayr was soon to face a most difficult
			test for a boy of his age, a test which shook the peaceful and
			loving atmosphere of his home and challenged the steadfastness of
			his faith.
		</p>
		<p>
			In the ninth year after the Hijrah, the Prophet, peace and
			blessings of God be on him, announced his intention to lead an
			expedition to Tabuk against the Byzantine forces. He ordered the
			Muslims to get themselves ready and make the necessary
			preparations.
		</p>
		<p>
			Usually when the Prophet wanted to go on a military campaign he
			would not give precise details of his objective or he would set
			off in a direction opposite to his intended destination. This was
			for security purposes and to confound the enemy's intelligence
			service. This he did not do in announcing the expedition to
			Tabuk. This was perhaps because of the great distance of Tabuk
			from Madinah, the enormous difficulties expected and the
			overwhelming strength of the enemy.
		</p>
		<p>
			The preparations needed for this expedition had to be extensive.
			In spite of the fact that summer had set in and the intense heat
			produced languor and listlessness, and in spite of the fact that
			the date crops needed harvesting, the Muslims responded
			enthusiastically to the call of the Prophet and busied themselves
			in preparing for the arduous campaign ahead.
		</p>
		<p>
			There was however a group of munafiqun or hypocrites who
			outwardly had declared their acceptance of Islam but inwardly did
			not believe in it. They were critical of the expedition and tried
			to weaken the resolve of the Muslims. They even ridiculed the
			Prophet in their private gatherings. Disbelief and hatred
			remained in their hearts.
		</p>
		<p>
			One day, shortly before the army was due to set out, the young
			Umayr ibn Sad returned home after performing Salat in the mosque.
			He was all agog with excitement. He had just witnessed the great
			generosity and the spontaneous spirit of sacrifice which the
			Muslims displayed in preparing for the expedition. He had seen
			women of the Muhajirin and the Ansar donating their jewellery and
			their ornaments to buy provisions and equipment for the army. He
			had seen Uthman ibn Affan handing over a purse containing a
			thousand gold dinars to the Prophet and Abdur Rahman ibn Awl
			carrying on his shoulders two hundred awqiyyah of gold and
			placing it before the noble Prophet. Indeed he had even seen a
			man trying to sell his bed in order to purchase a sword for
			himself.
		</p>
		<p>
			At home, he recalled these moving and inspiring scenes. He was
			surprised however that Julas was so slow in preparing for the
			expedition with the Prophet and at his delay in contributing
			especially since he was quite rich and could afford to give
			generously. Umayr felt that he had to arouse his ardor or stir
			his sense of generosity and manliness. So with great enthusiasm
			he related what he had seen and heard at the mosque particularly
			the case of those believers who, with great fervor, had come to
			enlist themselves in the army and were turned away by the Prophet
			because there was not sufficient means of transport. He related
			how sad and disappointed these people were at not realizing their
			desire to go on the path of Jihad and sacrifice for the sake of
			Islam. Julas' response was sharp and shocking.
		</p>
		<p>
			"If Muhammad is true in claiming that he is a Prophet ," he
			shouted angrily, "then we are all worse than donkeys."
		</p>
		<p>
			Umayr was flabbergasted. He could not believe what he had heard.
			He did not think that a man as intelligent as Julas could have
			uttered such words, words which put him instantly outside the
			pale of faith.
		</p>
		<p>
			A host of questions paced through his mind and he immediately
			began to consider what action he should take. He saw in Julas'
			silence and his tardiness to respond to the Prophet's call, clear
			signs of a traitor to God and His Prophet, who wanted to bring
			harm to Islam in just the same way as the munafiqun who were
			plotting and conspiring against the Prophet. At the same time he
			saw a man who had treated him as a father and who was kind and
			generous to him, who had taken him as an orphan and had saved him
			from poverty.
		</p>
		<p>
			Umayr had to choose between preserving this close relationship
			with Julas on the one hand and dealing with his treachery and
			hypocrisy on the other. The choice was painful but his decision
			was swift. He turned to Julas and said:
		</p>
		<p>
			"By God, O Julas, there is no one on the face of the earth, after
			Muhammad ibn Abdullah, dearer to me than you. You are the closest
			of men to me and you have been most generous to me. But you have
			uttered words which, if I should mention them will expose and
			humiliate you. If I conceal them, however, I will be a traitor to
			my trust and destroy myself and my religion. I will, therefore,
			go to the Messenger of God, peace be upon him, and tell him what
			you have said. It is up to you to clarify your position."
		</p>
		<p>
			The young Umayr went to the mosque and told the Prophet what he
			had heard from Julas. The Prophet asked him to stay with him and
			sent one of his companions to summon Julas.
		</p>
		<p>
			Julas came, greeted the Prophet and sat in front of him. The
			Prophet, peace be upon him straightaway asked him: "What did you
			say that Umayr ibn Sad heard?" and he mentioned what Umayr had
			reported to him.
		</p>
		<p>
			"He has lied against me, O Messenger of God, and has fabricated
			this. I have not uttered anything of the sort" asserted Julas.
		</p>
		<p>
			The companions of the Prophet looked alternately at Julas and
			Umayr hoping to detect on their faces what their hearts
			concealed. They began to mutter among themselves. One of those in
			whose hearts was the disease of hypocrisy asserted:
		</p>
		<p>
			"The youth is a nuisance. He is bent on defaming someone who has
			been good to him." Others replied: "Not at all. He is a youth who
			grew up in obedience to God. The expressions on his face attest
			to his truthfulness."
		</p>
		<p>
			The Prophet, peace be on him, turned to Umayr and saw his flushed
			face and the tears streaming down his cheeks. Umayr prayed:
		</p>
		<p>
			"O Lord, send down a revelation on Your Prophet to verify what I
			have told him."  Julas meanwhile continued to defend what he had
			said: "What I have told you, O Messenger of God, is certainly the
			truth. If you wish, make us swear an oath in your presence. I
			swear by God that I did not say anything of the sort that Umayr
			reported to you."
		</p>
		<p>
			As the companions turned to Umayr to hear what he had to say,
			they saw the Prophet come under a special mood of serenity and
			they realized that he was being inspired. Immediately there was
			complete silence as they gazed intently at the Prophet in
			anticipation.
		</p>
		<p>
			At this point, fear and terror gripped Julas and he began to look
			tremulously at Umayr. The Prophet, having received the
			revelation, recited the words of God:
		</p>
		<p>
			"(The hypocrites) swear by God that they have said (nothing
			wrong); yet most certainly they have uttered a saying which is a
			denial of the truth, and have thus denied the truth after having
			professed their self-surrender to God; for they were aiming at
			something which was beyond their reach. And they could find no
			fault (with the Faith) save that God had enriched them and
			(caused) His Apostle to enrich them out of His bounty. Hence, if
			they repent, it will be for their own good; but if they turn
			away, God will cause them to suffer a grievous suffering in this
			world and in the life to come and they will find no helper on
			earth, and none to give them succour." (The Quran, Surah
			at-Tawbah, 9:74).
		</p>
		<p>
			Julas trembled with fear at what he heard and in his anguish,
			could hardly speak. Finally, he turned to the Prophet and said: 
			"I do repent, O Messenger of God. I do repent. Umayr told the
			truth and I lied. I beseech God to accept my repentance..."
		</p>
		<p>
			The Prophet turned to the young Umayr. Tears of joy moistened his
			youthful face, radiant with the light of faith. With his noble
			hand, the Prophet tenderly took his
		</p>
		<p>
			ear and said:
		</p>
		<p>
			"Young man, your ear has been true in what it heard and your Lord
			has confirmed the truth of what you said."  Julas returned to the
			fold of Islam and was a good and faithful Muslim thereafter. The
			companions realized that by his generosity and good treatment of
			Umayr, he had reformed. Whenever Umayr was mentioned, Julas would
			say:
		</p>
		<p>
			"My God reward Umayr with goodness on my behalf. He certainly
			saved me from kufr and preserved my neck from the fire of hell."
		</p>
		<p>
			Umayr grew up and distinguished himself in later years with the
			same devotion and firmness which he had shown in early life.
		</p>
		<p>
			During the caliphate of Umar ibn al-Khattab, the people of Hims
			in Syria complained much and bitterly of the governors appointed
			to the city even though Umar in particular used to pay special
			attention to the type of men he chose as his provincial
			governors. In selecting a governor, Umar would say:  "I want a
			man who when he is among the people and is not their amir, should
			not behave as their amir, and when he is among them as an amir,
			he should behave as one of them.
		</p>
		<p>
			"I want a governor who will not distinguish himself from the
			people by the clothes he wears, or the food he eats or the house
			he lives in."
		</p>
		<p>
			"I want a governor who would establish Salat among the people,
			treat them equitably and with justice and does not close his door
			when they come to him in need."
		</p>
		<p>
			In the light of the complaints of the people of Hims and going by
			his own criteria for a good governor, Umar ibn al-Khattab decided
			to appoint Umayr ibn Sad as governor of the region. This was
			despite the fact that Umayr at that time was at the head of a
			Muslim army traversing the Arabian peninsula and the region of
			great Syria, liberating towns, destroying enemy fortifications,
			pacifying the tribes and establishing masjids wherever he went.
			Umayr accepted the appointment as governor of Hims reluctantly
			because he preferred nothing better than Jihad in the path of
			God. He was still quite young, in his early twenties.
		</p>
		<p>
			When Umayr reached Hims he called the inhabitants to a vast
			congregational prayer. When the prayer was over he addressed
			them. He began by praising and giving thanks to God and sending
			peace and blessings on His Prophet Muhammad. Then he said:
		</p>
		<p>
			"O people! Islam is a mighty fortress and a sturdy gate. The
			fortress of Islam is justice and its gate is truth. If you
			destroy the fortress and demolish the gate you would undermine
			the defences of this religion.
		</p>
		<p>
			"Islam will remain strong so long as the Sultan or central
			authority is strong. The strength of the Sultan neither comes
			from flogging with the whip, nor killing with the sword but from
			ruling with justice and holding fast to truth."
		</p>
		<p>
			Umayr spent a full year in Hims during which, it is said, he did
			not write a single letter to the Amir al-Muminin. Nor did he send
			any taxes to the central treasury in Madinah, neither a dirham
			nor a dinar.
		</p>
		<p>
			Umar was always concerned about the performance of his governors
			and was afraid that positions of authority would corrupt them. As
			far as he was concerned, there was no one who was free from sin
			and corrupting influences apart from the noble Prophet, peace be
			upon him. He summoned his secretary and said:
		</p>
		<p>
			"Write to Umayr ibn Sad and say to him: "When the letter of the
			Amir al-Muminin reaches you, leave Hims and come to him and bring
			with you whatever taxes you have collected from the Muslims."
		</p>
		<p>
			Umayr received the letter. He took his food pouch and hung his
			eating, drinking and washing utensils over his shoulder. He took
			his spear and left Hims and the governorship behind him. He set
			off for Madinah on foot.
		</p>
		<p>
			As Umayr approached Madinah, he was badly sunburnt, his body was
			gaunt and his hair had grown long. His appearance showed all the
			signs of the long and arduous journey. Umar, on seeing him, was
			astonished. What's wrong with you, Umayr?" he asked with deep
			concern.
		</p>
		<p>
			"Nothing is wrong with me, O Amir al-Muminin," replied Umayr. "I
			am fine and healthy, praise be to God, and I carry with me all
			(my) worldly possessions."
		</p>
		<p>
			"And what worldly possessions have you got?" asked Umar thinking
			that he was carrying money for the Bayt al-mal or treasury of the
			Muslims."
		</p>
		<p>
			"I have my pouch in which I put my food provisions. I have this
			vessel from which I eat and which I use for washing my hair and
			clothes.  And I have this cup for making wudu and drinking..." 
			"Did you come on foot?" asked Umar. "Yes, O Amir al-Muminin." 
			"Weren't you given from your amirship an animal to ride on?" 
			"They did not give me one and I did not ask them."
		</p>
		<p>
			"And where is the amount you brought for the Baytalmal?"
		</p>
		<p>
			"I didn't bring anything."
		</p>
		<p>
			"And why not?"
		</p>
		<p>
			"When I arrived at Hims," said Umayr, "I called the righteous
			persons of the town to a meeting and gave them the responsibility
			of collecting the taxes. Whenever they collected any amounts of
			money I would seek their advice and spent it (all) on those who
			were deserving among them."
		</p>
		<p>
			At this point, Umar turned to his secretary and said:
		</p>
		<p>
			"Renew the appointment of Umayr to the governorship of Hims." 
			"Oh, come now," protested Umayr. "That is something which I do
			not desire. I shall not be a governor for you nor for anyone
			after you, O Amir al-Muminin."
		</p>
		<p>
			With that Umayr asked the Khalifah's permission to go to his
			village on the outskirts of Madinah to live there with his
			family. This Umar granted.
		</p>
		<p>
			A long time passed since Umayr had gone to his village and Umar
			decided to put him through a test to make sure of his
			circumstances. He said to one of his trusted aides called
			al-Harith:
		</p>
		<p>
			"Harith, go to Umayr ibn Sad and stay with him as though you were
			a guest. If you see on him any signs of luxury or good living,
			return quietly as you went. If, however, you find him in
			straitened circumstances give him these dinars." Umar handed
			Harith a bag with a hundred dinars.
		</p>
		<p>
			Al-Harith set our for Umayr's village and found his home after
			making enquiries.
		</p>
		<p>
			"As-salamu  alaykum wa rahmatullah," he greeted Umayr.
		</p>
		<p>
			"Wa  alaykum  as-salam	 wa  rahmatullahi  wa barakatuhu,"
			replied Umayr and asked, "From where have you come?"
		</p>
		<p>
			"From aI-Madinah."
		</p>
		<p>
			"How arr the Muslims there?"
		</p>
		<p>
			"Fine."
		</p>
		<p>
			"How is the Amir al-Muminin?"
		</p>
		<p>
			"He is fine and doing well."
		</p>
		<p>
			"Has he applied the hudud laws?"
		</p>
		<p>
			"Yes. He carried out the sentence of punishment on his own son
			for committing the crime of adultery. His son died as a result of
			the punishment." Al-Harith continued:  "O Allah, help Umar. I
			only know that he has a great love for you."
		</p>
		<p>
			Al-Harith stayed as Umayr's guest for three nights. On each night
			he was given only a small flat piece of barley bread. On the
			third day a local man said to Harith:
		</p>
		<p>
			"Umayr and his family are suffering great hardship. They only
			have these loaves which they have given you in preference to
			themselves. They are hungry and in great distress. Harith went to
			Umayr and gave him the bag of money.
		</p>
		<p>
			"What is this?" asked Umayr.
		</p>
		<p>
			"The Amir al-Muminin sent it to you."
		</p>
		<p>
			"Return it to him. Give him my greetings of peace and tell him
			that Umayr has no need of it."
		</p>
		<p>
			"Take it, O Umayr," shouted his wife who was listening to the
			conversation between her husband and his guest. "If you need it,
			you can spend it. If not, you can spend it in other appropriate
			ways, for those in need here are many."
		</p>
		<p>
			When al-Harith heard what she had said, he placed the dinars in
			front of Umayr and left. Umayr took the money and placed it in a
			small bag. He only went to sleep that night after he had
			distributed the money to those in need and especially to the
			children of those who had been martyred.
		</p>
		<p>
			Al-Harith returned to Madinah and was questioned by Umar
			al-Faruq.
		</p>
		<p>
			"What have you seen, Harith?"
		</p>
		<p>
			"A very distressing situation, O Amir al-Muminin."
		</p>
		<p>
			"Did you give him the dinars?"
		</p>
		<p>
			"Yes, O Amir al-Muminin."
		</p>
		<p>
			"What did he do with them?"
		</p>
		<p>
			"I don't know. But I think that he did not keep a single dirham
			of it for himself."
		</p>
		<p>
			Al-Faruq wrote to Umayr: "When you receive this letter, I do not
			put it down until you come to me."
		</p>
		<p>
			Umayr proceeded straightaway to Madinah. Umar greeted and
			welcomed him and proceeded to question him.
		</p>
		<p>
			"What did you do with the dinars, Umayr?" "You have no
			responsibility for the money after you have donated it to me."
		</p>
		<p>
			"I adjure you to tell me what you did with it."
		</p>
		<p>
			"I stored it away for myself so that I could benefit from
		</p>
		<p>
			it a day when neither wealth nor children will be of any avail." 
			Tears came to Umar's eyes as he said:
		</p>
		<p>
			"I swear that you are one of those who are hard against
			themselves even when they are in dire need." And he ordered a
			camel load of food and two garments to be given to Umayr who
			protested:
		</p>
		<p>
			"About the food, we do not need it, O Amir al-Mumineen. I left
			two saas of barley with my family and when we have finished that,
			Allah- Great and Exalted is He - will provide. As for the two
			garments, I will take them for (my wife). Her dress is now in
			tatters and she is almost naked."
		</p>
		<p>
			Not long after that meeting with Umar al-Faruq, Umayr ibn Sad
			passed away to his Lord. He was not weighted down with the cares
			and burdens of the world and he was concerned to provide plenty
			of provisions for the hereafter. Umar received the news of his
			death with a heavy heart and said in deep sorrow: "I have wished
			to have men like Umayr ibn Sad whose help I could seek in dealing
			with the affairs of Muslims."

	<biography name="Hudhayfah ibn al-Yaman">
		<p>
			"If you wish you may consider yourself among the Muhajirin or, if
			you wish, you may consider yourself one of the Ansar. Choose
			whichever is dearer to you."
		</p>
		<p>
			With these words, the Prophet, peace be upon him, addressed
			Hudhayfah ibn al-Yaman when he met him for the first time in
			Makkah. How did Hudhayfah come to have this choice'?
		</p>
		<p>
			His father, al-Yaman was a Makkan from the tribe of Abs. He had
			killed someone and had been forced to leave Makkah. He had
			settled down in Yathrib, becoming an ally (halif) of the Banu
			al-Ash-hal and marrying into the tribe. A son named Hudhayfah was
			born to him. The restrictions on his returning to Makkah were
			eventually lifted and he divided his time between Makkah and
			Yathrib but stayed more in Yathrib and was more attached to it.
		</p>
		<p>
			This was how Hudhayfah had a Makkan origin but a Yathribite
			upbringing. When the rays of Islam began to radiate over the
			Arabian peninsula, a delegation from the Abs tribe, which
			included al-Yaman, went to the Prophet and announced their
			acceptance of Islam. That was before the Prophet migrated to
			Yathrib.
		</p>
		<p>
			Hudhayfah grew up in a Muslim household and was taught by both
			his mother and father who were among the first persons from
			Yathrib to enter the religion of God. He therefore became a
			Muslim before meeting the Prophet, peace be upon him.
		</p>
		<p>
			Hudhayfah longed to meet the Prophet. From an early age, he was
			keen on following whatever news there was about him. The more he
			heard, the more his affection for the Prophet grew and the more
			he longed to meet him.
		</p>
		<p>
			He eventually journeyed to Makkah, met the Prophet and put the
			question to him, "Am I a muhajir or am I an Ansari, O
			Rasulullah?"
		</p>
		<p>
			"If you wish you may consider yourself among the muhajirin, or if
			you wish you may consider yourself one of the Ansar. Choose
			whichever is dearer to you," replied the Prophet. "Well, I am an
			Ansari. O Rasulullah," decided Hudhayfah.
		</p>
		<p>
			At Madinah, after the Hijrah, Hudhayfah became closely attached
			to the Prophet. He participated in all the military engagements
			except Badr. Explaining why he missed the Battle of Badr, he
			said: "I would not have missed Badr if my father and I had not
			been outside Madinah. The disbelieving Quraysh met us and asked
			where we were going. We told them we were going to Madinah and
			they asked whether we intended to meet Muhammad. We insisted that
			we only wanted to go to Madinah. They allowed us to go only after
			they extracted from us an undertaking not to help Muhammad
			against them and not to fight along with them.
		</p>
		<p>
			"When we came to the Prophet we told him about our undertaking to
			the Quraysh and asked him what should we do. He said that we
			should ignore the undertaking and seek God's help against them."
		</p>
		<p>
			Hudhayfah participated in the Battle of Uhud with his father. The
			pressure on Hudhayfah during the battle was great but he
			acquitted himself well and emerged safe and sound. A rather
			different fate, however, awaited his father.
		</p>
		<p>
			Before the battle, the Prophet, peace be on him, left alYaman,
			Hudhayfah's father, and Thabit ibn Waqsh with the other
			non-combatants including women and children. This was because
			they were both quite old. As the fighting grew fiercer, al-Yaman
			said to his friend: "You have no father (meaning you have no
			cares). What are we waiting for? We both have only a short time
			to live. Why don't we take our swords and join the Messenger of
			God, peace be on him? Maybe, God will bless us with martyrdom
			beside His Prophet."
		</p>
		<p>
			They quickly prepared for battle and were soon in the thick of
			the fighting. Thabit ibn Waqsh was blessed with shahdah at the
			hands of the mushrikin. The father of Hudhayfah, however was set
			upon by some Muslims who did not recognize who he was. As they
			flayed him, Hudhayfah cried out: "My father! My father! It's my
			father!"
		</p>
		<p>
			No one heard him. The old man fell, killed in error by the swords
			of his own brothers in faith. They were filled with pain and
			remorse. Grieved as he was, Hudhayfah said to them: "May God
			forgive you for He is the most Merciful of those who show mercy."
		</p>
		<p>
			The Prophet, peace be on him, wanted diyah (compensation) to be
			paid to Hudhayfah for the death of his father but Hudhayfah said:
			"He was simply seeking shahadah and he attained it. O Lord, bear
			witness that I donate the compensation for him to the Muslims."
		</p>
		<p>
			Because of this attitude, Hudhayfah's stature grew in the eyes of
			the Prophet, peace be on him. Hudhayfah had three qualities which
			particularly impressed the Prophet: his unique intelligence which
			he employed in dealing with difficult situations; his quick
			wittedness and spontaneous response to the call of action, and
			his ability to keep a secret even under persistent questioning.
		</p>
		<p>
			A noticeable policy of the Prophet was to bring out and use the
			special qualities and strengths of each individual companion of
			his. In deploying his companions, he was careful to choose the
			right man for the right task. This he did to excellent advantage
			in the case of Hudhayfah.
		</p>
		<p>
			One of the gravest problems the Muslims of Madinah had to face
			was the existence in their midst of hypocrites (munafiqun)
			particularly from among the Jews and their allies. Although many
			of them had declared their acceptance of Islam, the change was
			only superficial and they continued to plot and intrigue against
			the Prophet and the Muslims.
		</p>
		<p>
			Because of Hudhayfah's ability to keep a secret, the Prophet,
			peace be on him, confided in him the names of the munafiqin. It
			was a weighty secret which the Prophet did not disclose to any
			other off his companions. He gave Hudhayfah the task of watching
			the movements of the munafiqin, following their activities, and
			shielding the Muslims from the sinister danger they represented.
			It was a tremendous responsibility. The munafiqin, because they
			acted in secrecy and because they knew all the developments and
			plans of the Muslims from within presented a greater threat to
			the community than the outright hostility of the kuffar.
		</p>
		<p>
			From this time onwards. Hudhayfah was called "The Keeper of the
			Secret of the Messenger of Allah". Throughout his life he
			remained faithful to his pledge not to disclose the names of the
			hypocrites. After the death of the Prophet, the Khalifah often
			came-to him to seek his advice concerning their movements and
			activities but he remained tight-lipped and cautious.
		</p>
		<p>
			Umar was only able to find out indirectly who the hypocrites
			were. If anyone among the Muslims died, Umar would ask:
		</p>
		<p>
			"Has Hudhayfah attended his funeral prayer?"
		</p>
		<p>
			If the reply was 'yes', he would perform the prayer. If the reply
			was 'no', he became doubtful about the person and refrained from
			performing the funeral prayer for him.
		</p>
		<p>
			Once Umar asked Hudhayfah: "Is any of my governors a munafiq?"
			"One," replied Hudhayfah. "Point him out to me," ordered Umar.
			"That I shall not do," insisted Hudhayfah who later said that
			shortly after their conversation Umar dismissed the person just
			as if he had been guided to him.

			Hudhayfah's special qualities were made use of by the Prophet,
			peace be on him, at various times. One of the most testing of
			such occasions, which required the use of Hudhayfah's
			intelligence and his presence of mind, was during the Battle of
			the Ditch. The Muslims on that occasion were surrounded by
			enemies. The seige they had been placed under had dragged on. The
			Muslims were undergoing severe hardship and difficulties. They
			had expended practically all their effort and were utterly
			exhausted. So intense was the strain that some even began to
			despair.
		</p>
		<p>
			The Quraysh and their allies, meanwhile, were not much better
			off. Their strength and determination had been sapped. A violent
			wind overturned their tents, extinguished their fires and pelted
			their faces and eyes with gusts of sand and dust.
		</p>
		<p>
			In such decisive moments in the history of warfare, the side that
			loses is the one that despairs first and the one that wins is the
			one that holds out longer. The role of army intelligence in such
			situations often proves to be a crucial factor in determining the
			outcome of the battle.
		</p>
		<p>
			At this stage of the confrontation the Prophet, peace be on him,
			felt he could use the special talents and experience of Hudhayfah
			ibn al-Yaman. He decided to send Hudhayfah into the midst of the
			enemy's positions under cover of darkness to bring him the latest
			information on their situation and morale before he decided on
			his next move.
		</p>
		<p>
			Let us now leave Hudhayfah to relate what happened on this
			mission fraught with danger and even death.
		</p>
		<p>
			"That night, we were all seated in rows. Abu Sufyan and his men -
			the mushrikun of Makkah - were in front of us. The Jewish tribe
			of Banu Qurayzah were at our rear and we were afraid of them
			because of our wives and children. The night was stygian dark.
			Never before was there a darker night nor a wind so strong. So
			dark was the night that no one could see his fingers and the
			blast of the wind was like the peel of thunder.
		</p>
		<p>
			"The hypocrites began to ask the Prophet for permission to leave,
			saying, 'Our houses are exposed to the enemy.' Anyone who asked
			the Prophet's permission to leave was allowed to go. Many thus
			sneaked away until we were left with about three hundred men.
		</p>
		<p>
			"The Prophet then began a round of inspection passing us one by
			one until he reached me. I had nothing to protect me from the
			cold except a blanket belonging to my wife which scarcely reached
			my knees. He came nearer to
		</p>
		<p>
			me as I lay crouching on the ground and asked: 'Who is this?'
			'Hudhayfah,' replied. 'Hudhayfah?' he queried as I huddled myself
			closer to the ground too afraid to stand up because of the
			intense hunger and cold. 'Yes, O Messenger of God,' I replied.
			'Something is happening among the people (meaning the forces of
			Abu Sufyan). Infiltrate their encampment and bring me news of
			what's happening,' instructed the Prophet.
		</p>
		<p>
			"I set out. At that moment I was the most terrified person of all
			and felt terribly cold. The Prophet, peace be on him, prayed: 'O
			Lord, protect him from in front and from behind, from his right
			and from his left, from above and from below.'
		</p>
		<p>
			"By God, no sooner had the Prophet, peace be on him, completed
			his supplication than God removed from my stomach all traces of
			fear and from my body all the punishing cold. As I turned to go,
			the Prophet called me back to him and said: 'Hudhayfah, on no
			account do anything among the people (of the opposing forces)
			until you come back to me.'
		</p>
		<p>
			'Yes,' I replied.
		</p>
		<p>
			"I went on, inching my way under cover of darkness until I
			penetrated deep into the mushrikin camp and became just like one
			of them. Shortly afterwards, Abu Sufyan got up and began to
			address his men:
		</p>
		<p>
			'O people of the Quraysh, I am about to make a statement to you
			which I fear would reach Muhammad. Therefore, let every man among
			you look and make sure who is sitting next to him...'
		</p>
		<p>
			"On hearing this, I immediately grasped the hand of the man next
			to me and asked, 'Who are you?' (thus putting him on the
			defensive and clearing myself). "Abu Sufyan went on:
		</p>
		<p>
			'O people of the Quraysh, by God, you are not in a safe and
			secure place. Our horses and camels have perished. The Banu
			Qurayzah have deserted us and we have had unpleasant news about
			them. We are buffered by this bitterly cold wind. Our fires do
			not light and our uprooted tents offer no protection. So get
			moving. For myself, I am leaving.'
		</p>
		<p>
			"He went to his camel, untethered and mounted it. He struck it
			and it stood upright. If the Messenger of God, peace be on him,
			had not instructed me to do nothing until I returned to him, I
			would have killed Abu Sufyan then and there with an arrow.
		</p>
		<p>
			"I returned to the Prophet and found him standing on a blanket
			performing Salat. When he recognized me, he drew me close to his
			legs and threw one end of the blanket over me. I informed him of
			what had happened. He was extremely happy and joyful and gave
			thanks and praise to
		</p>
		<p>
			Hudhayfah lived in constant dread of evil and corrupting
			influences. He felt that goodness and the sources of good in this
			life were easy to recognize for those who desired good. But it
			was evil that was deceptive and often difficult to perceive and
			combat.
		</p>
		<p>
			He became something of a great moral philosopher. He always
			warned people to struggle against evil with all their faculties,
			with their heart, hands and tongue. Those who stood against evil
			only with their hearts and tongues, and not with their hands, he
			considered as having abandoned a part of truth. Those who hated
			evil only in their hearts but did not combat it with their
			tongues and hands forsook two parts of truth and those who
			neither detested nor confronted evil with their hearts, tongues
			or hands he considered as physically alive but morally dead.
		</p>
		<p>
			Speaking about 'hearts' and their relationship to guidance and
			error, he once said: "There are four kinds of hearts. The heart
			that is encased or atrophied. That is the heart of the kafir or
			ungrateful disbeliever. The heart that is shaped into thin
			layers. That is the heart of the munafiq or hypocrite. The heart
			that is open and bare and on which shines a radiant light. That
			is the heart of the mumin or the believer.
		</p>
		<p>
			Finally there is the heart in which there is both hypocrisy and
			faith. Faith is like a tree which thrives with good water and
			hypocrisy is like an abscess which thrives on pus and blood.
			Whichever flourishes more, be it the tree of faith or the abscess
			of hypocrisy, wins control of the heart."
		</p>
		<p>
			Hudhayfah's experience with hypocrisy and his efforts to combat
			it gave a touch of sharpness and severity to his tongue. He
			himself realized this and admitted it with a noble courage: "I
			went to the Prophet, peace be on him and said: 'O Messenger of
			God, I have a tongue which is sharp and cutting against my family
			and I fear that this would lead me to hell-fire.' And the
			Prophet, peace be upon him, said to me: 'Where do you stand with
			regard to istighfar - asking forgiveness from Allah? I ask Allah
			for forgiveness a hundred times during the day. "
		</p>
		<p>
			A pensive man like Hudhayfah, one devoted to thought, knowledge
			and reflection may not have been expected to perform feats of
			heroism in battlefields. Yet Hudhayfah was to prove himself one
			of the foremost Muslim military commanders in the expansion of
			Islam into Iraq. He distinguished himself at Hamadan, ar-Rayy,
			ad-Daynawar, and at the famous Battle of Nihawand.
		</p>
		<p>
			For the encounter at Nihawand against the Persian forces,
			Hudhayfah was placed second in command by Umar over the entire
			Muslim forces which numbered some thirty thousand. The Persian
			forces outnumbered them by five to one being some one hundred and
			fifty thousand strong. The first commander of the Muslim army,
			an-Numan ibn Maqran, fell early in the battle. The second in
			command, Hudhayfah, immediately took charge of the situation,
			giving instructions that the death of the commander should not be
			broadcast. Under Hudhayfah's daring and inspiring leadership, the
			Muslims won a decisive victory despite tremendous odds.
		</p>
		<p>
			Hudhayfah was made governor of important places like Kufa and
			Ctesiphon (al-Madain). When the news of his appointment as
			governor of Ctesiphon reached its inhabitants, crowds went out to
			meet and greet this famous companion of the Prophet of whose
			piety and righteousness they had heard so much. His great role in
			the conquests of Persia was already a legend.
		</p>
		<p>
			As the welcoming party waited, a lean, somewhat scrawny man with
			dangling feet astride a donkey approached. In his hand he held a
			loaf of bread and some salt and he ate as he went along. When the
			rider was already in their midst they realized that he was
			Hudhayfah, the governor for whom they were waiting. They could
			not contain their surprise. What manner of man was this! They
			could however be excused for not recognizing him for they were
			used to the style, the pomp and the grandeur of Persian rulers.
		</p>
		<p>
			Hudhayfah carried on and people crowded around him. He saw they
			were expecting him to speak and he cast a searching look at their
			faces. Eventually, he said: "Beware of places of fitnah and
			intrigue."  "And what," they asked, "are places of intrigue?" He
			replied: "The doors of rulers where some people go and try to
			make the ruler or governor believe lies and praise him for
			(qualities) he does not possess."
		</p>
		<p>
			With these words, the people were prepared for what to expect
			from their new governor. They knew at once that there was nothing
			in the world that he despised more than hypocrisy.

	<biography name="Jafar ibn Abi Talib">
		<p>
			In spite of his noble standing among the Quraysh, Abu Talib, an
			uncle of the Prophet, was quite poor. He had a large family and
			did not have enough means to support them adequately. His
			poverty-stricken situation became much worse when a severe
			drought hit the Arabian peninsula. The drought destroyed
			vegetation and livestock and, it is said, people were driven to
			eat bones in the struggle for survival.
		</p>
		<p>
			It was during this time of drought, before his call to
			prophethood, that Muhammad said to his uncle, al Abbas: "Your
			brother, Abu Talib, has a large family. People as you see have
			been afflicted by this severe drought and are facing starvation.
			Let us go to Abu Talib and take over responsibility for some of
			his family. It will take one of his sons and you can taken
			another and we will look after them."
		</p>
		<p>
			"What you suggest is certainly righteous and commendable,"
			replied al-Abbas, and together they went to Abu Talib and said to
			him: "We want to ease some of the burden of your family until
			such time as this distressing period has gone." Abu Talib agreed.
		</p>
		<p>
			"If you allow me to keep Aqeel (one of his sons older than Ali),
			then you may do whatever you like ," he said.
		</p>
		<p>
			It was in this way that Muhammad took Ali into his household and
			al-Abbas took Jafar into his. Jafar had a very close resemblance
			to the Prophet. It is said there were five men from the Hashim
			clan who resembled the Prophet so much, they were often mistaken
			for him. They were: Abu Sufyan ibn al-Harith and Qutham ibn
			al-Abbas both of whom were cousins of his. As-Saib ibn Ubayd, the
			grandfather of Imam ash Shafi: al-Hasan ibn Ali, the grandson of
			the Prophet, who resembled him most of all; and Jafar ibn Abi
			Talib.
		</p>
		<p>
			Jafar stayed with his uncle, al-Abbas, until he was a young man.
			Then he married Asma bint Umays, a sister of Maymunah who was
			later to become a wife of the Prophet. After his marriage, Jafar
			went to live on his own. He and his wife were among the first
			persons to accept Islam. He became a Muslim at the hands of Abu
			Bakr as-Siddiq, may God be pleased with him.
		</p>
		<p>
			The young Jafar and his wife were devoted followers of Islam.
			They bore the harsh treatment and the persecution of the Quraysh
			with patience and steadfastness because they both realized that
			the road to Paradise was strewn with. thorns and paved with pain
			and hardship.
		</p>
		<p>
			The Quraysh made life intolerable for them both and for their
			brethren in faith. They tried to obstruct them from observing or
			performing the duties and rites of Islam. They prevented them
			from tasting the full sweetness of worship undisturbed. The
			Quraysh waylaid them at every turn and severely restricted their
			freedom of movement.
		</p>
		<p>
			Jafar eventually went to the Prophet, peace be upon him, and
			sought permission for himself and a small group of the Sahabah,
			including his wife, to make hijrah to the land of Abyssinia. With
			great sadness, the Prophet gave his permission. It pained him
			that these pure and righteous souls should be forced to leave
			their homes and the familiar and cherished scenes and memories of
			their childhood and youth, not for any crime but only because
			they said, "Our Lord is One. Allah is our Lord."
		</p>
		<p>
			The group of Muhajirin left Makkah bound for the land of
			Abyssinia. Leading them was Jafar ibn Abi Talib. Soon they
			settled down in this new land under the care and protection of
			the Negus, the just and righteous ruler of Abyssinia. For the
			first time since they became Muslims, they savoured the taste of
			freedom and security and enjoyed the sweetness of worship
			undisturbed.
		</p>
		<p>
			When the Quraysh learnt of the departure of the small group of
			Muslims and the peaceful life they enjoyed under the protection
			of the Negus, they made plans to secure their extradition and
			their return to the great prison that was Makkah. They sent two
			of their most formidable men, Amr ibn al-Aas and Abdullah ibn Abi
			Rabiah, to accomplish this task and loaded them with valuable and
			much sought after presents for the Negus and his bishops.
		</p>
		<p>
			In Abyssinia, the two Quraysh emissaries first presented their
			girls to the bishops and to each of them they said: "There are
			some wicked young people moving about freely in the King's land.
			They have attacked the religion of their forefathers and caused
			disunity among their people. When we speak to the King about
			them, advise him to surrender them to us without his asking them
			about their religion. The respected leaders of their own people
			are more aware of them and know better what they believe."
		</p>
		<p>
			The bishops agreed.
		</p>
		<p>
			Amr and Abdullah then went to the Negus himself and presented him
			with gifts which he greatly admired. They said to him: "O King,
			there is a group of evil persons from among our youth who have
			escaped to your kingdom. They practice a religion which neither
			we nor you know. They have forsaken our religion and have not
			entered into your religion. The respected leaders of their people
			- from among their own parents and uncles. and from their own
			clans - have sent us to you to request you to return them. They
			know best what trouble they have caused."
		</p>
		<p>
			The Negus looked towards his bishops who said: "They speak the
			truth, O King. Their own people know them better and are better
			acquainted with what they have done. Send them back so that they
			themselves might judge them."
		</p>
		<p>
			The Negus was quite angry with this suggestion and said: "No. By
			God, I won't surrender them to anyone until I myself call them
			and question them about what they have been accused. If what
			these two men have said is true, then I will hand them over to
			you. If however it is not so, then I shall protect them so long
			as they desire to remain under my protection."
		</p>
		<p>
			The Negus then summoned the Muslims to meet him. Before going,
			they consulted with one another as a group and agreed that Jafar
			ibn Abi Talib and no one else should speak on their behalf.
		</p>
		<p>
			In the court of the Negus, the bishops, dressed in green
			surplises and impressive headgear, were seated on his right and
			on his left. The Qurayshite emissaries were also seated when the
			Muslims entered and took their seats. The Negus turned to them
			and asked:
		</p>
		<p>
			"What is this religion which you have introduced for yourself and
			which has served to cut you off from the religion of your people?
			You also did not enter my religion nor the religion of any other
			community."
		</p>
		<p>
			Jafar ibn Abi Talib then advanced and made a speech that was
			moving and eloquent and which is still one of the most compelling
			descriptions of Islam. the appeal of the noble Prophet and the
			condition of Makkan society at the time. He said: "O King, we
			were a people in a state of ignorance and immorality, worshipping
			idols and eating the flesh of dead animals, committing all sorts
			of abomination and shameful deeds. breaking the ties of kinship,
			treating guests badly and the strong among us exploited the weak.
			"We remained in this state until Allah sent us a Prophet, one of
			our own people whose lineage, truthfulness, trustworthiness and
			integrity were well-known to us. "He called us to worship Allah
			alone and to renounce the stones and the idols which we and our
			ancestors used to worship besides Allah.
		</p>
		<p>
			"He commanded us to speak the truth, to honor our promises, to be
			kind to our relations, to be helpful to our neighbors, to cease
			all forbidden acts, to abstain from bloodshed. to avoid
			obscenities and false witness, not to appropriate an orphan's
			property nor slander chaste women.
		</p>
		<p>
			"He ordered us to worship Allah alone and not to associate
			anything with him, to uphold Salat, to give Zakat and fast in the
			month of Ramadan.
		</p>
		<p>
			"We believed in him and what he brought to us from Allah and we
			follow him in what he has asked us to do and we keep away from
			what he forbade us from doing.
		</p>
		<p>
			"Thereupon, O King, our people attacked us, visited the severest
			punishment on us to make us renounce our religion and take us
			back to the old immorality and the worship of idols.
		</p>
		<p>
			"They oppressed us, made life intolerable for us and obstructed
			us from observing our religion. So we left for your country,
			choosing you before anyone else, desiring your protection and
			hoping to live in Justice and in peace m your midst."
		</p>
		<p>
			The Negus was impressed and was eager to hear more. He asked
			Jafar: "Do you have with you something of what your
		</p>
		<p>
			Prophet brought concerning God?" "Yes," replied Jafar.
		</p>
		<p>
			"Then read it to me," requested the Negus. Jafar, in his rich,
			melodious voice recited for him the first portion of Surah Maryam
			which deals with the story of Jesus and his mother Mary.
		</p>
		<p>
			On hearing the words of the Quran, the Negus was moved to tears.
			To the Muslims, he said: "The message of your Prophet and that of
			Jesus came from the same source..." To Amr and his companion, he
			said:"	Go. For, by God, I will never surrender them to you."
			That, however, was not the end of the matter. The wily Amr made
			up his mind to go to the King the following day "to mention
			something about the Muslims belief which will certainly fill his
			heart with anger and make him detest them" On the morrow, Amr
			went to the Negus and said:
		</p>
		<p>
			"O King. these people to whom you have given refuge and whom you
			protect say something terrible about Jesus the son of Mary (that
			he is a slave). Send for them and ask them what they say about
			him."
		</p>
		<p>
			The Negus summoned the Muslims once more and Jafar acted as their
			spokesman. The Negus put the question: "What do you say about
			Jesus, the son of Mary?"
		</p>
		<p>
			"Regarding him, we only say what has been revealed to our Prophet
			," replied Jaffar.  "And what is that?" enquired the Negus.
		</p>
		<p>
			"Our Prophet says that Jesus is the servant of God and His
			Prophet. His spirit and His word which He cast into Mary the
			Virgin."
		</p>
		<p>
			The Negus was obviously excited by this reply and exclaimed: "By
			God, Jesus the son of Mary was exactly as your Prophet has
			described him"
		</p>
		<p>
			The bishops around the Negus grunted in disgust at what they had
			heard and were reprimanded by the Negus. He turned to the Muslims
			and said:
		</p>
		<p>
			"Go, for you are safe and secure. Whoever obstructs you will pay
			for it and whoever opposes you will be punished. For, by God, I
			would rather not have a mountain of gold than that anyone of you
			should come to any harm."
		</p>
		<p>
			Turning to Amr and his companion, he instructed his attendants:
			"Return their gifts to these two men. I have no need of them."
			Amr and his companion left broken and frustrated. The Muslims
			stayed on in the land of the Negus who proved to be most generous
			and kind to his guests.
		</p>
		<p>
			Jafar and his wife Asma spent about ten years in Abyssinia which
			became a second home for them. There, Asma gave birth to three
			children whom they named Abdullah, Muhammad and Awn. Their second
			child was possibly the first child in the history of the Muslim
			Ummah to be given the name Muhammad after the noble Prophet, may
			God bless him and grant him peace.
		</p>
		<p>
			In the seventh year of the hijrah, Jafar and his family left
			Abyssinia with a group of Muslims and headed for Madinah. When
			they arrived the Prophet was just returning from the successful
			conquest of Khaybar. He was so overjoyed at meeting Jafar that he
			said: "I do not know what fills me with more happiness, the
			conquest of Khaybar or the coming of Jafar."
		</p>
		<p>
			Muslims in general and the poor among them especially were just
			as happy with the return of Jafar as the Prophet was. Jafar
			quickly became known as a person who was much concerned for the
			welfare of the poor and indigent. For this he was nicknamed, the
			"Father of the Poor". Abu Hurayrah said of him: "The best of men
			towards us indigent folk was Jafar ibn Abi Talib. He would pass
			by us on his way home and give us whatever food he had. Even if
			his own food had run out, he would send us a pot in which he had
			placed some butterfat and nothing more. We would open it and lick
			it clean..."
		</p>
		<p>
			Jafar's stay in Madinah was not long. At the beginning of the
			eighth year of the hijrah, the Prophet mobilized an army to
			confront Byzantine forces in Syria because one of his emissaries
			who had gone in peace had been treacherously killed by a
			Byzantine governor. He appointed Zayd ibn Harithah as commander
			of the army and gave the following instructions: "If Zayd is
			wounded or killed, Jafar ibn Abi Talib would take over the
			command. If Jafar is killed or wounded, then your commander would
			be Abdullah ibn Rawahah. If Abdullah ibn Rawahah is killed, then
			let the Muslims choose for themselves a commander."
		</p>
		<p>
			The Prophet had never given such instructions to an army before
			and the Muslims took this as an indication that he expected the
			battle to be tough and that they would even suffer major losses.
		</p>
		<p>
			When the Muslim army reached Mutah, a small village situated
			among hills in Jordan, they discovered that the Byzantines had
			amassed a hundred thousand men backed up by a massive number of
			Christian Arabs from the tribes of Lakhm, Judham, Qudaah and
			others. The Muslim army only numbered three thousand.
		</p>
		<p>
			Despite the great odds against them, the Muslim forces engaged
			the Byzantines in battle. Zayd ibn al-Harithah, the beloved
			companion of the Prophet, was among the first to fall. Jafar ibn
			Abi Talib then assumed command. Mounted on his ruddy-complexioned
			horse, he penetrated deep into the Byzantine ranks. As he spurred
			his horse on, he called out: "How wonderful is Paradise as it
			draws near! How pleasant and cool is its drink! Punishment for
			the Byzantines is not far away!" Jafar continued to fight
			vigorously but was eventually slain. The third in command,
			Abdullah ibn Rawahah, also fell. Khalid ibn al-Walid, the
			inveterate fighter who had recently accepted Islam, was then
			chosen as the commander. He made a tactical withdrawal,
			redeployed the Muslims and renewed the attack from several
			directions. Eventually, the bulk of the Byzantine forces fled in
			disarray.
		</p>
		<p>
			The news of the death of his three commanders reached the Prophet
			in Madinah. The pain and grief he felt was intense. He went to
			Jafar's house and met his wife Asma. She was getting ready to
			receive her absent husband. She had prepared dough and bathed and
			clothed the children. Asma said: "When the Messenger of God
			approached us, I saw a veil of sadness shrouding his noble face
			and I became very apprehensive. But I did not dare ask him about
			Jafar for fear that I would hear some unpleasant news. He greeted
			and asked, 'Where are Jaffar's children?' I called them for him
			and they came and crowded around him happily, each one wanting to
			claim him for himself. He leaned over and hugged them while tears
			flowed from his eyes.
		</p>
		<p>
			'O Messenger of God,' I asked, 'why do you cry? Have you heard
			anything about Jafar and his two companions?'
		</p>
		<p>
			'Yes,' he replied. 'They have attained martyrdom.' The smiles and
			the laughter vanished from the faces of the little children when
			they heard their mother crying and wailing. Women came and
			gathered around Asma.
		</p>
		<p>
			"O Asma," said the Prophet, "don't say anything objectionable and
			don't beat your breast." He then prayed to God to protect and
			sustain the family of Jafar and assured them that he had attained
			Paradise.
		</p>
		<p>
			The Prophet left Asma's house and went to his daughter Fatimah
			who was also weeping. To her, he said: "For such as Jafar, you
			can (easily) cry yourself to death. Prepare food for Jafar's
			family for today they are beside themselves with grief."

	<biography name="Abu Sufyan ibn al-Harith">
		<p>
			Rarely can one find a closer bond between two persons such as
			existed between Muhammad the son of Abdullah and Abu Sufyan the
			son of al-Harith. (This Abu Sufyan of course was not the same as
			Abu Sufyan ibn Harb, the powerful Quraysh chieftain.)
		</p>
		<p>
			Abu Sufyan ibn al-Harith was born about the same time as the
			blessed Prophet. They resembled each other a great deal. They
			grew up together and for a time lived in the same household. Abu
			Sufyan was a cousin of the Prophet. His father, al-Harith, was
			the brother of Abdullah; both were sons of Abd al-Muttalib.
		</p>
		<p>
			Abu Sufyan was also a foster-brother of the Prophet. He was for a
			short time nursed by the lady Halimah who looked after the young
			Muhammad in the tough and bracing atmosphere of the desert.
		</p>
		<p>
			In their childhood and youth, Abu Sufyan and Muhammad were close
			and intimate friends. So close were they, that one might
			naturally have expected Abu Sufyan to have been among the first
			to respond to the call of the Prophet, peace be upon him, and
			follow wholeheartedly the religion of truth. But this was not to
			be, at least not for many, many years.
		</p>
		<p>
			From the time the Prophet made public his call to Islam and first
			issued the warning to members of his clan about the dangers of
			continuing in their existing state of unbelief, injustice and
			immorality, the fire of envy and hatred erupted in the breast of
			Abu Sufyan. The bonds of kinship snapped. Where once there was
			love and friendship, there was now revulsion and hate. Where once
			there was brotherhood, there was now resistance and opposition.
		</p>
		<p>
			Abu Sufyan at this time was renowned as one of the best fighters
			and horsemen of the Quraysh and one of their most accomplished
			poets. He used both sword and tongue in the battle against the
			Prophet and his mission. All his energies were mobilized in
			denouncing Islam and persecuting the Muslims. In whatever battle
			the Quraysh fought against the Prophet and whatever torture and
			persecution they meted out to the Muslims Abu Sufyan had a part
			to play. He composed and recited verses attacking and vilifying
			the Prophet.
		</p>
		<p>
			For twenty years almost this rancor consumed his soul. His three
			others brothers - Nawfal, Rabiah and Abdullah, had all accepted
			Islam but not he.
		</p>
		<p>
			In the eighth year after the Hijrah, however, shortly before the
			Islamic liberation of Makkah, Abu Sufyan's position began to
			shift, as he explains: "When the movement of Islam became
			vigorous and well-established and news spread of the Prophet's
			advance to liberate Makkah, the world caved in on me. I felt
			trapped. 'Where shall I go?' I asked myself. 'And with whom?' To
			my wife and children, I said:
		</p>
		<p>
			'Get ready to leave Makkah. Muhammad's advance is imminent. I
			shall certainly be killed. I shall be given no quarter should the
			Muslims recognize me.'
		</p>
		<p>
			'Now,' replied my family, 'you must realize that Arabs and
			non-Arabs have pledged their obedience to Muhammad and accepted
			his religion. You are still bent on opposing him whereas you
			might have been the first to support and help him.'
		</p>
		<p>
			They continued trying to influence me to re-consider my attitude
			to Muhammad's religion and to re-awaken in me affection towards
			him. Eventually God opened my heart to Islam. I got up and said
			to my servant, Madhkur: 'Get ready a camel and a horse for us.' I
			took my son Jafar with me and we galloped with great speed
			towards al-Abwa between Makkah and Madinah. I had learnt that
			Muhammad had camped there. As I approached the place, I covered
			my face so that no one could recognize and kill me before I could
			reach the Prophet and announce my acceptance of Islam directly to
			him.
		</p>
		<p>
			Slowly, I proceeded on foot while advance groups of Muslims
			headed towards Makkah. I avoided their path out of fear that one
			of the Prophet's companions would recognize me. I continued in
			this fashion until the Prophet on his mount came into my view.
			Coming out into the open, I went straight up to him and uncovered
			my face. He looked at me and recognized me. But, he turned his
			face away. I moved to face him once again. He avoided looking at
			me and again turned away his face. This happened repeatedly.
		</p>
		<p>
			I had no doubt - as I stood there facing the Prophet that he
			would have been pleased with my acceptance of Islam and that his
			companions would have rejoiced at his happiness.  When, however,
			the Muslims saw the Prophet, peace be on him, avoiding me, they
			too looked at me and shunned me. Abu Bakr met me and violently
			turned away. I looked at Umar ibn al-Khattab, my eyes pleading
			for his compassion, but I found him even more harsh than Abu
			Bakr. In fact, Umar went on to incite one of the Ansar against
			me.
		</p>
		<p>
			'O enemy of God,' lashed out the Ansari, 'you are the one who
			persecuted the Messenger of God, peace be on him, and tortured
			his companions. You carried your hostility towards the Prophet to
			the ends of the earth'.
		</p>
		<p>
			The Ansari went on censuring me in a loud voice while other
			Muslims glared at me in anger. At that point, I saw my uncle,
			al-Abbas, and went to him seeking refuge.
		</p>
		<p>
			'O uncle,' I said. 'I had hoped that the Prophet, peace be on
			him, would be happy about my acceptance of Islam because of my
			kinship to him and because of my position of honor among my
			people. You know what his reaction has been. Speak to him then on
			my behalf that he may be pleased with me.'
		</p>
		<p>
			'No, by God,' replied my uncle. 'I shall not speak to him at all
			after I have seen him turning away from you except if an
			opportunity presents itself. I do honor the Prophet, peace and
			blessings of God be on him, and I stand in awe of him.'
		</p>
		<p>
			'O uncle, to whom then will you abandon me?' I pleaded.
		</p>
		<p>
			'I do not have anything for you except what you have heard,' he
			said.
		</p>
		<p>
			Anxiety and grief took hold of me. I saw Ali ibn Talib soon after
			and spoke to him about my case. His response was the same as that
			of my uncle. I went back to my uncle and said to him: 'O uncle,
			if you cannot soften the heart of the Prophet towards me, then at
			least restrain that man from denouncing me and inciting others
			against me.'
		</p>
		<p>
			'Describe him to me,' said my uncle. I described the man to him
			and he said: 'That is Nuayman ibn al-Harith an-Najjari.' He sent
			for Nuayman and said to him: 'O Nuayman! Abu Sufyan is the cousin
			of the Prophet and my nephew. If the Prophet is angry with him
			today, he will be pleased with him another day. So leave him...'
			My uncle continued trying to placate Nuayman until the latter
			relented and said: 'I shall not spurn him anymore.'
		</p>
		<p>
			"When the Prophet reached al-Jahfah (about four days journey from
			Makkah), I sat down at the door of his tent. My son Jafar stood
			beside me. As he was leaving his tent, the Prophet saw me and
			averted his face. Yet, I did not despair of seeking his pleasure.
			Whenever he camped at a place, I would sit at his door and my son
			Jafar would stand in front of me... I continued in this fashion
			for some time. But the situation became too much for me and I
			became depressed. I said to myself:
		</p>
		<p>
			'By God, either the Prophet, peace be on him, shows he is pleased
			with me or I shall take my son and go wandering through the land
			until we die of hunger and thirst.'
		</p>
		<p>
			When the Prophet came to hear of this, he relented and, on
			leaving his tent, he looked more gently towards me then before. I
			so much hoped that he would smile."
		</p>
		<p>
			Eventually the Prophet relented and told Abu Sufyan, "There is
			now no blame on you." He entrusted the newcomer to Islam to Ali
			ibn Abi Talib saying: "Teach your cousin how to perform wudu and
			about the Sunnah. Then bring him back to me." When Ali returned,
			the Prophet said:
		</p>
		<p>
			"Tell all the people that the Messenger of God is pleased with
			Abu Sufyan and that they should be pleased with him."
		</p>
		<p>
			Abu Sufyan continued: "The Prophet then entered Makkah and I too
			entered in his entourage. He went to the Sacred Mosque and I also
			went, trying my best to remain in his presence and not separate
			from him on any account...
		</p>
		<p>
			Later, at the Battle of Hunayn. the Arabs put together an
			unprecedented force against the Prophet, peace be on him... They
			were determined to deal a mortal blow to Islam and the Muslims.
		</p>
		<p>
			The Prophet went out to confront them with a large number of his
			companions. I went out with him and when I saw the great throngs
			of mushrikin, I said: 'By God. today, I shall atone for all my
			past hostility towards the Prophet. peace be on him, and he shall
			certainly see on my part what pleases God and what pleases him.'
		</p>
		<p>
			When the two forces met, the pressure of the mushrikin on the
			Muslims was severe and the Muslims began to lose heart. Some even
			began to desert and terrible defeat stared us in the face.
			However, the Prophet stood firm in the thick of battle astride
			his mule "Ash-Shahba" like a towering mountain, wielding his
			sword and fighting for himself and those around him... I jumped
			from my horse and fought beside him. God knows that I desired
			martyrdom beside the Messenger of God. My uncle, al-Abbas, took
			the reins of the Prophet's mule and stood at his side. I took up
			my position on the other side. With my right hand I fended off
			attacks against the Prophet and with my left I held on to my
			mount.
		</p>
		<p>
			When the Prophet saw my devastating blows on the enemy, he asked
			my uncle: 'Who's this?' 'This is your brother and cousin. Abu
			Sufyan ibn al-Harith. Be pleased with him. O Messenger of God.'
		</p>
		<p>
			'I have done so and God has granted forgiveness to him for all
			the hostility he has directed against me.'
		</p>
		<p>
			My heart soared with happiness. I kissed his feet in the stirrup
			and wept. He turned towards me and said: 'My brother! Upon my
			life! Advance and strike!'
		</p>
		<p>
			The words of the Prophet spurred me on and we plunged into the
			positions of the mushrikin until they were routed and fled in
			every direction."
		</p>
		<p>
			After Hunayn, Abu Sufyan ibn al-Harith continued to enjoy the
			good pleasure of the Prophet and the satisfaction of being in his
			noble company. But he never looked the Prophet directly in the
			eye nor focussed his gaze on his face out of shame and
			embarrassment for his past hostility towards him.
		</p>
		<p>
			Abu Sufyan continued to feel intense remorse for the many and
			dark days he had spent trying to extinguish the light of God and
			refusing to follow His message. Henceforth, his days and nights
			he would spend reciting the verses of the Quran. seeking to
			understand and follow its laws and profit by its admonitions. He
			shunned the world and its adornments and turned to God with every
			fibre of his being. Once the Prophet. peace be on him, saw him
			entering the mosque and asked his wife: "Do you know who is this,
			Aishah?"  "No, O Messenger of God." she replied. This is my
			cousin. Abu Sufyan ibn al-Harith. See, he is the first to enter
			the masjid and the last to leave. His eyes do not leave his
			shoelace."
		</p>
		<p>
			When the Prophet, peace be on him, passed away, Abu Sufyan felt
			intense grief and wept bitterly.
		</p>
		<p>
			During the caliphate of Umar, may God be pleased with him, Abu
			Sufyan felt his end drawing near. One day people saw him in
			al-Baqi, the cemetery not far from the Prophet's mosque where
			many Sahabah are buried. He was digging and fashioning a grave.
			They were surprised. Three days later, Abu Sufyan was lying
			stretched out at home His family stood around weeping but he
			said: "Do not weep for me. By God, I did not commit any wrong
			since I accepted Islam." With that, he passed away.

	<biography name="Hakim ibn Hazm">
		<p>
			History has recorded that he is the only person who was born
			inside the Kabah itself.
		</p>
		<p>
			Together with a group of friends, his mother had gone inside this
			ancient House of God to inspect it. On that particular day it was
			open because of a festive occasion. She was pregnant and labor
			pains suddenly gripped her. She was unable to leave the Kabah. A
			leather mat was brought to her and she gave birth on it. The
			child was named Hakim. His father was Hazm who was the son of
			Khuwaylid. Hakim was therefore the nephew of the Lady Khadijah,
			the daughter of Khuwaylid. may Allah be pleased with her.
		</p>
		<p>
			Hakim grew up in a wealthy and noble family which enjoyed a high
			status in Makkan society. He was also an intelligent and
			well-mannered person who was well respected by his people. He was
			held in such esteem that he was given the responsibility of the
			rifadah which involved giving assistance to the needy and those
			who had lost their property during the season of pilgrimage. He
			took this responsibility seriously and would even help needy
			pilgrims from his own resources.
		</p>
		<p>
			Hakim was a very close friend of the Prophet, peace be on him,
			before the latter's call to prophethood. Even though he was five
			years older than the Prophet, he used to spend much time talking
			to him and enjoying hours of pleasant companionship. Muhammad in
			his turn felt great affection for Hakim.
		</p>
		<p>
			Their relationship was further strengthened when the Prophet
			married his aunt, Khadijah bint Khuwaylid.
		</p>
		<p>
			What is truly amazing is that in spite of the close friendship
			between Hakim and the Prophet, Hakim did not become a Muslim
			until the conquest of Makkah, more than twenty years after the
			start of the Prophet's mission. One would have thought that
			someone like Hakim whom God had blessed with a sound intellect
			and who was so well-disposed to the Prophet, would have been
			among the first to believe in him and follow the guidance  he
			brought. But that was not to be.
		</p>
		<p>
			Just as we are astonished at the late acceptance of Islam on the
			part of Hakim, he himself later in life was also amazed. In fact,
			as soon as he accepted Islam and tasted the sweetness of iman
			(faith), he began to feel deep regret for every moment of his
			life as a mushrik and a denier of God's religion and of His
			Prophet.
		</p>
		<p>
			His son once saw him weeping after his acceptance of Islam and
			asked: "Why are you weeping, my father'?"  "Many things cause me
			to weep, my dear son. The most grievous is the length of time it
			took for me to become a Muslim. Acceptance of Islam would have
			given me so many opportunities to do good which I missed even if
			I were to have spent the earth in gold. My life was spared at the
			battle of Badr and also at the battle of Uhud. After Uhud. I said
			to myself. I would not help any Quraysh against Muhammad, may the
			peace and blessings of God be upon him, and I would not leave
			Makkah. Then, whenever I felt like accepting Islam I would look
			at other men among the Quraysh. men of power and maturity who
			remained firmly attached to the ideas and practices of Jahiliyyah
			and I would fall in line with them and their neighbors... Oh, how
			I wish I had not done so. Nothing has destroyed us except the
			blind following of our forefathers and elders. Why should I not
			weep, my son?"
		</p>
		<p>
			The Prophet himself was puzzled. A man of sagacity and
			understanding like Hakim ibn Hazm, how could Islam remain
			"hidden" from him?. For a long time, the Prophet had dearly hoped
			that he and a group of persons like him would take the initiative
			and become Muslims. On the night before the liberation of Makkah,
			he, may God bless him and grant him peace, said to his
			companions:
		</p>
		<p>
			"There are four persons in Makkah whom I consider to be above
			having any dealing with shirk and I would dearly like them to
			accept Islam."	"Who are they, O Messenger of God?" asked the
			companions. "Attab ibn Usayd, Jubayr ibn Mutim, Hakim ibn Hazm
			and Suhayl ibn Amr," replied the Prophet. By the grace of God,
			they all became Muslims.
		</p>
		<p>
			When the Prophet, peace be on him, entered Makkah to liberate the
			city from polytheism and the ways of ignorance and immorality, he
			ordered his herald to proclaim: "Whoever declares that there is
			no god but Allah alone, that He has no partner and that Muhammad
			is His servant and His Messenger, he is safe...
		</p>
		<p>
			Whoever sits at the Kabah and lays down his weapons, he is safe.
			Whoever enters the house of Abu Sufyan, he is safe.
		</p>
		<p>
			Whoever enters the house of Hakim ibn Hazm, he is safe..."  The
			house of Abu Sufyan was in the higher part of Makkah and that of
			Hakim was in the lower part of the city. By proclaiming these
			houses as places of sanctuary, the Prophet wisely accorded
			recognition to both Abu Sufyan and Hakim, weakening any thought
			they might have of resisting and making it easier for them to be
			more favorably disposed to him and his mission.
		</p>
		<p>
			Hakim embraced Islam wholeheartedly. He vowed to himself that he
			would atone for whatever he had done during his Jahili days and
			that whatever amounts he had spent in opposing the Prophet, he
			would spend the same amounts in the cause of Islam.
		</p>
		<p>
			He owned the Dar an-Nadwah, an important and historic building in
			Makkah, where the Quraysh held their conferences during the days
			of Jahiliyyah. In this building the Quraysh leaders and
			chieftains would gather to plot against the Prophet.
		</p>
		<p>
			Hakim decided to get rid of it and cut himself off from its past
			associations which were now so painful to him. He sold the
			building for one hundred thousand dirhams. A Quraysh youth
			exclaimed to him:  "You have sold something of great historical
			value and pride to the Quraysh, uncle."
		</p>
		<p>
			"Come now, my son," replied Hakim. "All vain pride and glory has
			now gone and all that remains of value is taqwa - consciousness
			of God. I have only sold the building in order to acquire a house
			in Paradise. I swear to you that I have given the proceeds from
			it to be spent in the path of God Almighty."
		</p>
		<p>
			Hakim ibn Hazm performed the Hajj after becoming a Muslim. He
			took with him one hundred fine camels and sacrificed them all in
			order to achieve nearness to God. In the following Hajj, he stood
			on Arafat. With him were one hundred slaves. To each he gave a
			pendant of silver on which was engraved: "Free for the sake of
			God Almighty from Hakim ibn Hazm." On a third Hajj, he took with
			him a thousand sheep - yes a thousand sheep and sacrificed them
			all at Mina to feed the poor Muslims in order to attain nearness
			to God.
		</p>
		<p>
			While Hakim was generous in his spending for the sake of God, he
			also still liked to have much. After the battle of Hunayn, he
			asked the Prophet for some of the booty which the Prophet gave.
			He then asked for more and the Prophet gave him more. Hakim was
			still a newcomer to Islam and the Prophet was more generous to
			newcomers so as to reconcile their hearts to Islam. Hakim ended
			up with a large share of the booty. But the Prophet peace be upon
			him, told him:
		</p>
		<p>
			"O Hakim! This wealth is indeed sweet and attractive. Whoever
			takes it and is satisfied will be blessed by it and whoever takes
			out of greed will not be blessed. He would be like someone who
			eats and is not satisfied. The upper hand is better than the
			lower hand (it is better to give than to receive)."
		</p>
		<p>
			The kind words of advice had a deep and immediate effect on
			Hakim. He was mortified and said to the Prophet: "O Messenger of
			God! By Him who has sent you with the truth, I shall not ask
			anyone after you for anything."
		</p>
		<p>
			During the caliphate of Abu Bakr, Hakim was called several times
			to collect his stipend from the Bayt al-mal but he refused to
			take any money. He did the same during the caliphate of Umar ibn
			al-Khattab whereupon Umar addressed the Muslims: "I testify to
			you, O Muslims, that I have called Hakim to collect his stipend
			but he refuses."
		</p>
		<p>
			Hakim remained faithful to his word. He did not take anything
			from anyone until he passed away. From the Prophet, he had learnt
			the great truth that contentment is riches beyond compare.
		</p>

	<biography name="Suhayl ibn Amr">
		<p>
			At the Battle of Badr, when Suhayl fell into the hands of the
			Muslims as a prisoner, Umar ibn al-Khattab came up to the Prophet
			and said: "Messenger of God! Let me pull out the two middle
			incisors of Suhayl ibn Amr so that he would not stand up and be
			able to speak out against you after this day."
		</p>
		<p>
			"Certainly not, Umar," cautioned the Prophet. "I would not
			mutilate anyone lest God mutilate me even though I am a Prophet."
			And calling Umar closer to him, the blessed Prophet said:
		</p>
		<p>
			"Umar, perhaps Suhayl will do something in the future which will
			please you."
		</p>
		<p>
			Suhayl ibn Amr was a prominent person among the Quraysh. He was
			clever and articulate and his opinion carried weight among his
			people. He was known as the khatib or spokesman and orator of the
			Quraysh. He was to play a major role in concluding the famous
			truce of Hudaybiyyah.
		</p>
		<p>
			Towards the end of the sixth year after the Hijrah, the Prophet
			and about fifteen hundred of his Sahabah left Madinah for Makkah
			to perform Umrah. To make it known that they were coming in
			peace, the Muslims were not armed for battle and carried only
			their travellers swords. They also took with them animals for
			sacrifice to let it be known that they were really coming on
			pilgrimage.
		</p>
		<p>
			The Quraysh learnt of their approach and immediately prepared to
			do battle with them. They vowed to themselves that they would
			never allow the Muslims to enter Makkah. Khalid ibn al-Walid was
			despatched at the head of a Quraysh cavalry force to cut off the
			approaching Muslims. Khalids army stood waiting for them at a
			place called Kara al-Ghamim.
		</p>
		<p>
			The Prophet learnt in advance of Khalid's position. Although
			committed to the struggle against them, he was keen not to have
			any encounter then with the Quraysh forces. He asked: "Is there
			any man who could take us (to Makkah) on a different route to
			avoid the Quraysh?"
		</p>
		<p>
			A man from the Aslam tribe said he could and took the Muslims
			through the difficult terrain of Warah and then on fairly easy
			marches, finally approaching Makkah from the south. Khalid
			realized what the Muslims had done and returned frustrated to
			Makkah.
		</p>
		<p>
			The Prophet camped near Hudaybiyyah and indicated that if the
			Quraysh would give any hint of a truce out of veneration for the
			sacred time and place, he would respond. The Quraysh sent Badil
			ibn Warqa with a group of men from the Khuzaah tribe to find out
			why the Muslims had come. Badil met the Prophet and when he
			returned to the Quraysh and informed them of the peaceful
			intentions of the Prophet and his companions, they did not
			believe him because they said he was from the Khuzaah who were
			allies of Muhammad. "Does Muhammad intend," they asked, "to come
			upon us with his soldiers (in the guise of) performing Umrah? The
			Arabs would hear that he moved against us and entered Makkah by
			force white a state of war existed between us. By God this will
			never happen with our approval."
		</p>
		<p>
			The Quraysh then sent Halis ibn Alqamah, the chieftain of the
			Ahabish who were allies of the Quraysh. When the Prophet, peace
			be on him, saw Halis he said, "This man is from a people who
			think greatly of animal sacrifice. Drive the sacrificial animals
			in full view of him so that he can see them. This was done and
			Halis was greeted by the Muslims chanting the talbiyyah: "Labbayk
			Allahumma Labbayk." On his return, Halis exclaimed: "Subhana
			Allah - Glory be to God. These people should not be prevented
			from entering Makkah. Can lepers and donkeys perform the Hajj
			while the son of alMuttaIib (Muhammad) be prevented from
			(visiting) the House of God? By the Lord of the Kabah, may the
			Quraysh be destroyed. These people have come to perform Umrah."
		</p>
		<p>
			When the Quraysh heard these words, they scoffed at him: "Sit
			down! You are only a nomad Arab. You have no knowledge of plots
			and intrigues."
		</p>
		<p>
			Urwah ibn Masud, the Thaqafi chieftain from Tail, was then sent
			out to assess the situation. He said to the Prophet: "O Muhammad!
			You have gathered all these people and have come back to your
			birthplace. The Quraysh have come out and pledged to God that you
			would not enter Makkah against them by force. By God, all these
			people might well desert you." At that Abu Bakr went up to Urwah
			and said with disdain: "We desert him (Muhammad)? Woe to you."
		</p>
		<p>
			As Urwah was speaking, he touched the Prophet's
		</p>
		<p>
			beard and Mughirah ibn Shubah rapped his hand saying, "Take away
			your hand," and Urwah retorted: "Woe to you! How crude and coarse
			you are." The Prophet smiled. "Who is this man, O Muhammad?"
			asked Urwah. "This is your cousin, Al-Mughirah ibn Shubah." "What
			perfidy!" Urwah hissed at Al-Mughirah and continued to insult
			him.
		</p>
		<p>
			Urwah then surveyed the companions of the Prophet. He saw that
			whenever he gave them an order, they hastened to carry it out.
			When he made ablutions they vied with one another to help him.
			When they spoke in his presence, they lowered their voices, and
			they did not look him in the eye out of respect for him.
		</p>
		<p>
			Back with the Quraysh, Urwah showed that he was obviously
			impressed: "By God, O people of the Quraysh, I have been to
			Chosroes in his kingdom and I have seen Caesar the Byzantine
			emperor in the plenitude of his power, but never have I seen a
			king among his people like Muhammad among his companions. I have
			seen a people who would not abandon him for anything. Reconsider
			your position. He is presenting you with right guidance. Accept
			what he has presented to you. I advise you sincerely... I fear
			that you will never gain victory over him."
		</p>
		<p>
			"Don't speak like that," said the Quraysh. "We will have him go
			back this year and he can return in the future." Meanwhile, the
			Prophet summoned Uthman ibn Allan and sent him to the Quraysh
			leaders to inform them of his purpose in coming to Makkah and to
			ask their permission for the MusIims to visit their relatives.
			Uthman was also to cheer up the Mustadafin among the Muslims who
			still lived in Makkah and inform them that liberation would not
			be long in coming...
		</p>
		<p>
			Uthman delivered the Prophet's message to the Quraysh and they
			repeated their determination not to allow the Prophet to enter
			Makkah. They suggested that Uthman could make tawaf around the
			Kabah but he replied that he would not make tawaf while the
			Messenger of God was prevented from doing so. They then took
			Uthman into custody and a rumor spread that he was killed. When
			the Prophet heard this, his attitude changed.
		</p>
		<p>
			"We shall not depart," he said, "until we fight." He summoned the
			Muslims to take bayah, an oath of allegiance, to fight. The
			herald cried out: "O people, al-bayah, al-bayah." They flocked to
			the Prophet as he sat under a tree and swore allegiance to him
			that they would fight. Soon after however, the Prophet
			ascertained that the rumor was false.
		</p>
		<p>
			It was at this point that the Quraysh sent Suhayl ibn Amr to the
			Messenger of God with the brief to negotiate and persuade the
			Prophet to return to Madinah without entering Makkah. Suhayl was
			chosen no doubt because of his persuasiveness, his toughness and
			his alertness major qualities of a good negotiator. When the
			Prophet saw Suhayl approaching, he immediately guessed the change
			in the position of the Quraysh. "The people want reconciliation.
			That's why they have sent this man."
		</p>
		<p>
			The talks between the Prophet and Suhayl continued for long until
			finally agreement was reached in principle. Umar and others were
			very upset with the terms of the agreement which they considered
			to be harmful to the cause of Islam and a defeat for the Muslims.
			The Prophet assured them that this was not the case and that he
			would never go against the command of God and that God would not
			neglect him. He then called Ali ibn Abi Talib to write down the
			terms of the treaty: "Write: Bismillahi-r Rahmani-r Rahim." "I
			don't know this (phrase)", interjected Suhayl. "Write instead
			'Bismika Allahumma - In Your name, O Allah."
		</p>
		<p>
			The Prophet conceded and instructed Ali to write 'Bismika
			Allahumma.' He then said: "Write: 'This is what has been agreed
			between Muhammad the Messenger of God and Suhayl ibn Amr..."
			Suhayl objected: "If I had testified that you were indeed the
			Messenger of God, I would not be fighting you. Write instead you
			name and the name of your father." So the Prophet again conceded
			this and instructed Ali to write: 'This is what has been agreed
			upon by Muhammad the son of Abdullah and Suhayl ibn Amr. They
			have agreed to suspend war for ten years in which people would
			enjoy security and would refrain from (harming) one another.
			Also, that whoever from among the Quraysh should come to Muhammad
			without the permission of his wali (legal guardian), Muhammad
			would send him back to them and that if any who is with Muhammad
			should come to the Quraysh, they would not send him back to him.
		</p>
		<p>
			Suhayl had managed to save the Makkans face. He had attempted to
			and got as much as possible for the Quraysh in the negotiations.
			Of course he was assisted in this by the noble tolerance of the
			Prophet.
		</p>
		<p>
			Two years of the Hudaybiyyah treaty elapsed during which the
			Muslims enjoyed a respite from the Quraysh and were freed to
			concentrate on other matters. In the eighth year after the Hijrah
			however the Quraysh broke the terms of the treaty by supporting
			the Banu Bakr in a bloody aggression against the Khuzaah who had
			chosen to be allies of the Prophet.
		</p>
		<p>
			The Prophet took the opportunity to march on Makkah but his
			object was not revenge. Ten thousand Muslims converged on Makkah
			reaching there in the month of Ramadan. The Quraysh realized that
			there was no hope of resisting let alone of defeating the Muslim
			forces. They were completely at the mercy of the Prophet. What
			was to be their fate, they who had harried and persecuted the
			Muslims, tortured and boycotted them, driven them out of their
			hearths and homes, stirred up others against them, made war on
			them?
		</p>
		<p>
			The city surrendered to the Prophet. He received the leaders of
			the Quraysh in a spirit of tolerance and magnanimity. In a voice
			full of compassion and tenderness he asked: "O people of the
			Quraysh! What do you think I will do with you?" Thereupon, the
			adversary of Islam of yesterday, Suhayl ibn Amr, replied: "We
			think (you will treat us) well, noble brother, son of a noble
			brother. ". "A radiant smile flashed across the lips of the
			beloved of God as he said: "Idhhabu... wa antum at-tulaqaa. Go,
			for you are free."
		</p>
		<p>
			At this moment of unsurpassed compassion, nobility and greatness,
			all the emotions of Suhayl ibn Amr were shaken and he announced
			his Islam or submission to Allah, the Lord of all the worlds. His
			acceptance of Islam at that particular time was not the Islam of
			a defeated man passively giving himself up to his fate. It was
			instead, as his later life was to demonstrate, the Islam of a man
			whom the greatness of Muhammad and the greatness of the religion
			he proclaimed had captivated.
		</p>
		<p>
			Those who became Muslims on the day Makkah was liberated were
			given the name "At-Tulaqaa" or the free ones. They realized how
			fortunate they were and many dedicated themselves in sincere
			worship and sacrifice to the service of the religion which they
			had resisted for years. Among the most prominent of these was
			Suhayl ibn Amr.
		</p>
		<p>
			Islam moulded him anew. Ali his earlier talents were now
			burnished to a fine excellence. To these he added new talents and
			placed them all in the service of truth, goodness and faith. The
			qualities and practices for which he became known can be
			described in a few words: kindness, generosity, frequent Salat,
			fasting, recitation of the Quran, weeping for the fear of God.
			This was the greatness of Suhayl. In spite of his late acceptance
			of Islam, he was transformed into a selfless worshipper and a
			fighting fidai in the path of God.
		</p>
		<p>
			When the Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace, passed
			away, the news quickly reached Makkah, where Suhayl was still
			resident. The Muslims were plunged into a state of confusion and
			dismay just as in Madinah. In Madinah, Abu Bakr, may God be
			pleased with him, quelled the confusion with his decisive words:
			"Whoever worships Muhammad, Muhammad is dead. And whoever
			worships Allah, Allah is indeed Living and will never die."
		</p>
		<p>
			In Makkah Suhayl performed the same role in dispelling the vain
			ideas some Muslims may have had and directing them to the eternal
			truths of Islam. He called the Muslims together and in his
			brilliant and salutary style, he affirmed to them that Muhammad
			was indeed the Messenger of Allah and that he did not die until
			he had discharged his trust and propagated the message and that
			it was the duty of all believers after his death to apply
			themselves assiduously to following his example and way of life.
		</p>
		<p>
			On this day more than others, the prophetic words of the
			Messenger shone forth. Did not the Prophet say to Umar when the
			latter sought permission to pull out Suhayls teeth at Badr:
			"Leave them, for one day perhaps they would bring you joy"?
		</p>
		<p>
			When the news of Suhayl's stand in Makkah reached the Muslims of
			Madinah and they heard of his persuasive speech strengthening the
			faith in the hearts of the believers, Umar ibn al-Khattab
			remembered the words of the Prophet. The day had come when Islam
			benefitted from the two middle incisors of Suhayl which Umar had
			wanted to pull out.
		</p>
		<p>
			When Suhayl became a Muslim he made a vow to himself which could
			be summarized in these words: to exert himself and spend in the
			cause of Islam at least in the same measure as he had done for
			the mushrikin. With the mushrikin, he had spent long hours before
			their idols. Now he stood for long periods with the believers in
			the presence of the one and only God, praying and fasting.
		</p>
		<p>
			Before he had stood by the mushrikin and participated in many
			acts of aggression and war against Islam. Now he took his place
			in the ranks of the Muslim army, fighting courageously, pitting
			himself against the fire of Persia and the injustice and
			oppression of the Byzantine empire.
		</p>
		<p>
			In this spirit he left for Syria with the Muslim armies and
			participated in the Battle of Yarmuk against the Byzantines, a
			battle that was singularly ferocious in its intensity.
		</p>
		<p>
			Suhayl was someone who loved his birthplace dearly. In spite of
			that, he refused to return to Makkah after the victory of the
			MusIims in Syria. He said: "I heard the Messenger of God, peace
			be on him, say: 'The going forth of anyone of you in the path of
			God for an hour is better for him than his life's works in his
			household.' "He vowed: "I shall be a murabit in the path of God
			till I die and I shall not return to Makkah."
		</p>
		<p>
			For the rest of his life, Suhayl remained true to his pledge. He
			died in Palestine in the small village of 'Amawas near Jerusalem.

	<biography name="Zayd ibn Thabit">
		<p>
			We are in the second year of the Hijrah. Madinah the city of the
			Prophet is buzzing with activity as the Muslims prepare for the
			long march southwards to Badr.
		</p>
		<p>
			The noble Prophet made a final inspection of the first army to be
			mobilized under his leadership to wage Jihad against those who
			had tormented the Muslims for many years and who were still bent
			on putting an end to his mission.
		</p>
		<p>
			A youth, not yet thirteen, walked up to the ranks. He was
			confident and alert. He held a sword which was as long or
			possibly slightly longer than his own height. He went up to the
			Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace, and said: "I
			dedicate myself to you, Messenger of God. Permit me to be with
			you and to fight the enemies of God under your banner."
		</p>
		<p>
			The noble Prophet looked at him with admiration and patted his
			shoulder with loving tenderness. He commended him for his courage
			but refused to enlist him because he was still too young.
		</p>
		<p>
			The youth, Zayd ibn Thabit, turned and walked away, dejected and
			sad. As he walked, in slow and measured paces, he stuck his sword
			in the ground as a sign of his disappointment. He was denied the
			honor of accompanying the Prophet on his first campaign. Behind
			him was his mother, an-Nawar bint Malik. She felt equally
			dejected and sad. She had dearly wished to see her young son go
			with the army of mujahidin and to be with the Prophet at this
			most critical time.
		</p>
		<p>
			One year later, as preparations were underway for the second
			encounter with the Quraysh which took place at Uhud, a group of
			Muslim teenagers bearing arms of various kinds - swords, spears,
			bows and arrows and shields - approached the Prophet. They were
			seeking to be enlisted in any capacity in the Muslim ranks. Some
			of them, like Rafi ibn Khadij and Samurah ibn Jundub, who were
			strong and well-built for their age and who demonstrated their
			ability to wrestle and handle weapons, were granted permission by
			the Prophet to join the Muslim forces. Others like Abdullah the
			son of Umar and Zayd ibn Thabit were still considered by the
			Prophet to be too young and immature to fight. He promised though
			to consider them for a later campaign. It was only at the Battle
			of the Ditch when Zayd was about sixteen years old that he was at
			last allowed to bear arms in defence of the Muslim community.
		</p>
		<p>
			Although Zayd was keen to participate in battles, it is not as a
			warrior that he is remembered. After his rejection for the Badr
			campaign, he accepted the fact then that he was too young to
			fight in major battles. His alert mind turned to other fields of
			service, which had no connection with age and which could bring
			him closer to the Prophet, peace be on him. He considered the
			field of knowledge and in particular of memorizing the Quran. He
			mentioned the idea to his mother. She was delighted and
			immediately made attempts to have his ambition realized. An-Nuwar
			spoke to some men of the Ansar about the youth's desire and they
			in turn broached the matter with the Prophet, saying: "O
			Messenger of Allah, our son Zayd ibn Thabit has memorized
			seventeen surahs of the Book of Allah and recites them as
			correctly as they were revealed to you. In addition to that he is
			good at reading and writing. It is in this field of service that
			he desires to be close to you. Listen to him if you will."
		</p>
		<p>
			The Prophet, peace be on him, listened to Zayd reciting some
			surahs he had memorized. His recitation was clear and beautiful
			and his stops and pauses indicated clearly that he understood
			well what he recited. The Prophet was pleased. Indeed he found
			that Zayd's ability exceeded the commendation he had been given
			by his relatives. The Prophet then set him a task which required
			intelligence, skill and persistence.
		</p>
		<p>
			"Zayd, learn the writing of the Jews  for me," instructed the
			Prophet. "At your command, Messenger of Allah," replied Zayd who
			set about learning Hebrew with enthusiasm. He became quite
			proficient in the language and wrote it for the Prophet when he
			wanted to communicate with the Jews. Zayd also read and
			translated from Hebrew when the Jews wrote to the Prophet. The
			Prophet instructed him to learn Syriac also and this he did. Zayd
			thus came to perform the important function of an interpreter for
			the Prophet in his dealings with non-Arabic speaking peoples.
		</p>
		<p>
			Zayd's enthusiasm and skill were obvious. When the Prophet felt
			confident of his faithfulness in the discharge of duties and the
			care, precision and understanding with which he carried out
			tasks, he entrusted Zayd with the weighty responsibility of
			recording the Divine revelation.
		</p>
		<p>
			When any part of the Quran was revealed to the Prophet, he often
			sent for Zayd and instructed him to bring the writing materials,
			"the parchment, the ink-pot and the scapula", and write the
			revelation.
		</p>
		<p>
			Zayd was not the only one who acted as a scribe for the Prophet.
			One source has listed forty-eight persons who used to write for
			him. Zayd was very prominent among them. He did not only write
			but during the Prophet's time he collected portions of the Quran
			that were written down by others and arranged these under the
			supervision of the Prophet. He is reported to have said:
		</p>
		<p>
			"We used to compile the Quran from small manuscripts in the
			presence of the Prophet." In this way, Zayd experienced the Quran
			directly from the Prophet himself. It could be said that he grew
			up with the verses of the Quran, understanding well the
			circumstances  surrounding  each  revelation.  He  thus became
			well-versed in the secrets of the Shariah and at an early age
			gained the well-deserved reputation as a leading scholar among
			the companions of the Prophet.
		</p>
		<p>
			After the death of the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him
			peace, the task fell on this fortunate young man who specialized
			in the Quran to authenticate the first and most important
			reference for the ummah of Muhammad. This became an urgent task
			after the wars of apostasy and the Battle of Yamamah in
			particular in which a large number of those who had committed the
			Quran to memory perished.
		</p>
		<p>
			Umar convinced the Khalifah Abu Bakr that unless the Quran was
			collected in one manuscript, a large part of it was in danger of
			being lost. Abu Bakr summoned Zayd ibn Thabit and said to him:
			"You are an intelligent young man and we do not suspect you (of
			telling lies or of forgetfulness) and you used to write the
			Divine revelation for Allah's Messenger. Therefore look for (all
			parts of) the Quran and collect it in one manuscript."
		</p>
		<p>
			Zayd was immediately aware of the weighty responsibility. He
			later said: "By Allah, if he (Abu Bakr) had ordered me to shift
			one of the mountains from its place, it would not have been
			harder for me than what he had ordered me concerning the
			collection of the Quran."
		</p>
		<p>
			Zayd finally accepted the task and, according to him, "started
			locating the Quranic material and collecting it from parchments,
			scapula, leafstalks of date palms and from the memories of men
			(who knew it by heart)".
		</p>
		<p>
			It was a painstaking task and Zayd was careful that not a single
			error, however slight or unintentional, should creep into the
			work. When Zayd had completed his task, he left the prepared
			suhuf or sheets with Abu Bakr. Before he died, Abu Bakr left the
			suhuf with Umar who in turn left it with his daughter Hafsah.
			Hafsah, Umm Salamah and Aishah were wives of the Prophet, may
			Allah be pleased with them, who memorized the Quran.
		</p>
		<p>
			During the time of Uthman, by which time Islam had spread far and
			wide, differences in reading the Quran became obvious. A group of
			companions of the Prophet, headed by Hudhayfah ibn al-Yaman, who
			was then stationed in Iraq, came to Uthman and urged him to "save
			the Muslim ummah before they differ about the Quran".
		</p>
		<p>
			Uthman obtained the manuscript of the Quran from Hafsah and again
			summoned the leading authority, Zayd ibn Thabit, and some other
			competent companions to make accurate copies of it. Zayd was put
			in charge of the operation. He completed the task with the same
			meticulousness with which he compiled the original suhuf during
			the time of Abu Bakr.
		</p>
		<p>
			Zayd and his assistants wrote many copies. One of these Uthman
			sent to every Muslim province with the order that all other
			Quranic materials whether written in fragmentary manuscripts or
			whole copies be burnt. This was important in order to eliminate
			any variations or differences from the standard text of the
			Quran. Uthman kept a copy for himself and returned the original
			manuscript to Hafsah.
		</p>
		<p>
			Zayd ibn Thabit thus became one of the foremost authorities on
			the Quran. Umar ibn al-Khattab once addressed the Muslims and
			said: "O people, whoever wants to ask about the Quran, let him go
			to Zayd ibn Thabit."
		</p>
		<p>
			And so it was that seekers of knowledge from among the companions
			of the Prophet and the generation who succeeded them, known as
			the "Tabiun", came from far and wide to benefit from his
			knowledge. When Zayd died, Abu Hurayrah said: "Today, the scholar
			of this ummah has died."
		</p>
		<p>
			When a Muslim holds the Quran and reads it or hears it being
			recited, surah after surah, ayah after ayah, he should know that
			he owes a tremendous debt of gratitude and recognition to a truly
			great companion of the Prophet, Zayd ibn Thabit, for helping to
			preserve for all time to come the Book of Eternal Wisdom. Truly
			did Allah, the Blessed and Exalted, say: "Surely We have revealed
			the Book of Remembrance and We shall certainly preserve it." (The
			Quran, Surah al-Hijr, 15:9)
		</p>

	<biography name="Abdullah ibn Abbas">
		<p>
			Abdullah was the son of Abbas, an uncle of the noble Prophet. He
			was born just three years before the Hijrah. When the Prophet
			died, Abdullah was thus only thirteen years old.
		</p>
		<p>
			When he was born, his mother took him to the blessed Prophet who
			put some of his saliva on the babe's tongue even before he began
			to suckle. This was the beginning of the close and intimate tie
			between Abbas and the Prophet that was to be part of a life-long
			love and devotion.
		</p>
		<p>
			When Abdullah reached the age of discretion, he attached himself
			to the service of the Prophet. He would run to fetch water for
			him when he wanted to make wudu. During Salat, he would stand
			behind the Prophet in prayer and when the Prophet went on
			journeys or expeditions, he would follow next in line to him.
			Abdullah thus became like the shadow of the Prophet, constantly
			in his company.
		</p>
		<p>
			In all these situations he was attentive and alert to whatever
			the Prophet did and said. His heart was enthusiastic and his
			young mind was pure and uncluttered, committing the Prophet's
			words to memory with the capacity and accuracy of a recording
			instrument. In this way and through his constant researches
			later, as we shall see, Abdullah became one of the most learned
			companions of the Prophet, preserving on behalf of later
			generations of Muslims, the priceless words of the Messenger of
			God. It is said that he committed to memory about one thousand,
			six hundred and sixty sayings of the Prophet which are recorded
			and authenticated in the collections of al-Bukhari and Muslim.
		</p>
		<p>
			The Prophet would often draw Abdullah as a child close to him,
			pat him on the shoulder and pray: "O Lord, make him acquire a
			deep understanding of the religion of Islam and instruct him in
			the meaning and interpretation of things."
		</p>
		<p>
			There were many occasions thereafter when the blessed Prophet
			would repeat this dua or prayer for his cousin and before long
			Abdullah ibn Abbas realized that his life was to be devoted to
			the pursuit of learning and knowledge.
		</p>
		<p>
			The Prophet moreover prayed that he be granted not just knowledge
			and understanding but wisdom. Abdullah related the following
			incident about himself: "Once the Prophet, peace be upon him, was
			on the point of performing wudu. I hurried to get water ready for
			him. He was pleased with what I was doing. As he was about to
			begin Salat, he indicated that I should stand at his side.
			However, I stood behind him. When the Salat was finished, he
			turned to me and said: 'What prevented you from being at my side,
			O Abdullah?' 'You are too illustrious and too great in my eyes
			for me to stand side by side with you,' I replied.
		</p>
		<p>
			Raising his hands to the heavens, the Prophet then prayed: 'O
			Lord, grant him wisdom." The Prophet's prayer undoubtedly was
			granted for the young Abdullah was to prove time and again that
			he possessed a wisdom beyond his years. But it was a wisdom that
			came only with devotion and the dogged pursuit of knowledge both
			during the Prophet's lifetime and after his death.
		</p>
		<p>
			During the lifetime of the Prophet, Abdullah would not miss any
			of his assemblies and he would commit to memory whatever he said.
			After the Prophet passed away, he would take care to go to as
			many companions as possible especially those who knew the Prophet
			longer and learn from them what the Prophet had taught them.
			Whenever he heard that someone knew a hadith of the Prophet which
			he did not know he would go quickly to him and record it. He
			would subject whatever he heard to close scrutiny and check it
			against other reports. He would go to as many as thirty
			companions to verify a single matter.
		</p>
		<p>
			Abdullah described what he once did on hearing that a companion
			of the Prophet knew a hadith unknown to him: "I went to him
			during the time of the afternoon siesta and spread my cloak in
			front of his door. The wind blew dust on me (as I sat waiting for
			him). If I wished I could have sought his permission to enter and
			he would certainly have given me permission. But I preferred to
			wait on him so that he could be completely refreshed. Coming out
			of his house and seeing me in that condition he said: 'O cousin
			of the Prophet! What's the matter with you? If you had sent for
			me I would have come to you.' 'I am the one who should come to
			you, for knowledge is sought, it does not just come,' I said. I
			asked him about the hadith and learnt from him."
		</p>
		<p>
			In this way, the dedicated Abdullah would ask, and ask, and go on
			asking. And he would sift and scrutinize the information he had
			collected with his keen and meticulous mind.
		</p>
		<p>
			It was not only in the collection of hadith that Abdullah
			specialized. He devoted himself to acquiring knowledge in a wide
			variety of fields. He had a special admiration for persons like
			Zayd ibn Thabit, the recorder of the revelation, the leading
			judge and jurist consult in Madinah, an expert in the laws of
			inheritance and in reading the Quran. When Zayd intended to go on
			a trip, the young Abdullah would stand humbly at his side and
			taking hold of the reins of his mount would adopt the attitude of
			a humble servant in the presence of his master. Zayd would say to
			him: "Don't, O cousin of the Prophet."
		</p>
		<p>
			"Thus we were commanded to treat the learned ones among us,"
			Abdullah would say. "And Zayd would say to him in turn: "Let me
			see your hand." Abdullah would stretch out his hand. Zayd, taking
			it, would kiss it and say: "Thus we were commanded to treat the
			ahl al-bayt members of the household of the Prophet."
		</p>
		<p>
			As Abdullah's knowledge grew, he grew in stature. Masruq ibn al
			Ajda said of him: "Whenever I saw Ibn Abbas, I would say: He is
			the most handsome of men. When he spoke, I would say: He is the
			most eloquent of men. And when he held a conversation, I would
			say: He is the most knowledgeable of
		</p>
		<p>
			men."
		</p>
		<p>
			The Khalifah Umar ibn al-Khattab often sought his advice on
			important matters of state and described him as "the young man of
			maturity".
		</p>
		<p>
			Sad ibn abi Waqqas described him with these words: "I have never
			seen someone who was quicker in understanding, who had more
			knowledge and greater wisdom than Ibn Abbas. I have seen Umar
			summon him to discuss difficult problems in the presence of
			veterans of Badr from among the Muhajirin and Ansar. Ibn Abbas
			would speak and Umar would not disregard what he had to say."
		</p>
		<p>
			It is these qualities which resulted in Abdullah ibn Abbas being
			known as "the learned man of this Ummah".
		</p>
		<p>
			Abdullah ibn Abbas was not content to accumulate knowledge. He
			felt he had a duty to the ummah to educate those in search of
			knowledge and the general masses of the Muslim community. He
			turned to teaching and his house became a university - yes, a
			university in the full sense of the word, a university with
			specialized teaching but with the difference that there was only
			one teacher Abdullah ibn Abbas.
		</p>
		<p>
			There was an enthusiastic response to Abdullah's classes. One of
			his companions described a typical scene in front of his house:
			"I saw people converging on the roads leading to his house until
			there was hardly any room in front of his house. I went in and
			told him about the crowds of people at his door and he said: 'Get
			me water for wudu.'
		</p>
		<p>
			He performed wudu and, seating himself, said: 'Go out and say to
			them: Whoever wants to ask about the Quran and its letters
			(pronunciation) let him enter.'
		</p>
		<p>
			This I did and people entered until the house was filled.
			Whatever he was asked, Abdullah was able to elucidate and even
			provide additional information to what was asked. Then (to his
			students) he said: 'Make way for your brothers.'
		</p>
		<p>
			Then to me he said: 'Go out and say: Who wants to ask about the
			Quran and its interpretation, let him enter'.
		</p>
		<p>
			Again the house was filled and Abdullah elucidated and	provided 
			more  information  than  what  was requested."
		</p>
		<p>
			And so it continued with groups of people coming in to discuss
			fiqh (jurisprudence), halal and haram (the lawful and the
			prohibited in Islam), inheritance laws, Arabic language, poetry
			and etymology.
		</p>
		<p>
			To avoid congestion with many groups of people coming to discuss
			various subjects on a single day, Abdullah decided to devote one
			day exclusively for a particular discipline. On one day, only the
			exegesis of the Quran would be taught while on another day only
			fiqh (jurisprudence). The maghazi or campaigns of the Prophet,
			poetry, Arab history before Islam were each allocated a special
			day.
		</p>
		<p>
			Abdullah ibn Abbas brought to his teaching a powerful memory and
			a formidable intellect. His explanations were precise, clear and
			logical. His arguments were persuasive and supported by pertinent
			textual evidence and historical facts.
		</p>
		<p>
			One occasion when his formidable powers of persuasion was used
			was during the caliphate of Ali. A large number of supporters of
			Ali in his stand against Muawiyah had just deserted him. Abdullah
			ibn Abbas went to Ali and requested permission to speak to them.
			Ali hesitated fearing that Abdullah would be in danger at their
			hands but eventually gave way on Abdullah's optimism that nothing
			untoward would happen.
		</p>
		<p>
			Abdullah went over to the group. They were absorbed in worship.
			Some were not willing to let him speak but others were prepared
			to give him a hearing.
		</p>
		<p>
			"Tell me" asked Abdullah, "what grievances have you against the
			cousin of the Prophet, the husband of his daughter and the first
			of those who believed in him?"
		</p>
		<p>
			"The men proceeded to relate three main complaints against Ali.
			First, that he appointed men to pass judgment in matters
			pertaining to the religion of God - meaning that Ali had agreed
			to accept the arbitration of Abu Musa al-Asbari and Amr ibn al-As
			in the dispute with Muawiyah. Secondly, that he fought and did
			not take booty nor prisoners of war. Thirdly, that he did not
			insist on the title of Amir al-Muminin during the arbitration
			process although the Muslims had pledged allegiance to him and he
			was their legitimate amir. To them this was obviously a sign of
			weakness and a sign that Ali was prepared to bring his legitimate
			position as Amir al-Muminin into disrepute.
		</p>
		<p>
			In reply, Abdullah asked them that should he cite verses from the
			Quran and sayings of the Prophet to which they had no objection
			and which related to their criticisms, would they be prepared to
			change their position. They replied that they would and Abdullah
			proceeded: "Regarding your statement that Ali has appointed men
			to pass judgment in matters pertaining to Allah's religion, Allah
			Glorified and Exalted is He, says: 'O you who believe! Kill not
			game while in the sacred precincts or in pilgrim garb. If any of
			you do so intentionally, the compensation is an offering, of a
			domestic animal equivalent to the one he killed and adjudged by
			two just men among." "I adjure you, by God! Is the adjudication
			by men in matters pertaining to the preservation of their blood
			and their lives and making peace between them more deserving of
			attention than adjudication over a rabbit whose value is only a
			quarter of a dirham?"
		</p>
		<p>
			Their reply was of course that arbitration was more important in
			the case of preserving Muslim lives and making peace among them
			than over the killing of game in the sacred precincts for which
			Allah sanctioned arbitration by men.
		</p>
		<p>
			"Have we then finished with this point?" asked Abdullah and their
			reply was:  "Allahumma, naam - O Lord, yes!" Abdullah went on:
			"As for your statement that Ali fought and did not take prisoners
			of war as the Prophet did, do you really desire to take your
			"mother" Aishah as a captive and treat her as fair game in the
			way that captives are treated? If your answer is "Yes", then you
			have fallen into kufr (disbelief). And if you say that she is not
			your "mother", you would also have fallen into a state of kufr
			for Allah, Glorified and Exalted is He, has said: 'The Prophet is
			closer to the believers than their own selves and his wives are
			their mothers (entitled to respect and consideration).' (The
			Quran, Surah al-Ahzab, 34:6).
		</p>

			"Choose for yourself what you want," said Abdullah and then he
			asked: "Have we then finished with this point?" and this time too
			their reply was: "Allahumma, naam - O Lord, yes!" Abdullah went
			on: "As for your statement that Ali has surrendered the title of
			Amir al-Muminin, (remember) that the Prophet himself, peace and
			blessings of God be on him, at the time of Hudaybiyyah, demanded
			that the mushrikin write in the truce which he concluded with
			them: 'This is what the Messenger of God has agreed...' and they
			retorted: 'If we believed that you were the Messenger of God we
			would not have blocked your way to the Kabah nor would we have
			fought you. Write instead: 'Muhammad the son of Abdullah.' The
			Prophet conceded their demand while saying: 'By God, I am the
			Messenger of God even if they reject me."  At this point Abdullah
			ibn Abbas asked the dissidents: "Have we then finished with this
			point? and their reply was once again:
		</p>
		<p>
			"Allahumma, naam - O Lord, yes!"
		</p>
		<p>
			One of the fruits of this verbal challenge in which Abdullah
			displayed his intimate knowledge of the Quran and the sirah of
			the Prophet as well as his remarkable powers of argument and
			persuasion, was that the majority, about twenty thousand men,
			returned to the ranks of Ali. About four thousand however
			remained obdurate. These latter came to be known as Kharijites.
		</p>
		<p>
			On this and other occasions, the courageous Abdullah showed that
			he preferred peace above war, and logic against force and
			violence. However, he was not only known for his courage, his
			perceptive thought and his vast knowledge. He was also known for
			his great generosity and hospitality. Some of his contemporaries
			said of his household: "We have not seen a house which has more
			food or drink or fruit or knowledge than the house of Ibn Abbas."
		</p>
		<p>
			He had a genuine and abiding concern for people. He was
			thoughtful and caring. He once said: "When I realize the
			importance of a verse of God's Book, I would wish that all people
			should know what I know.
		</p>
		<p>
			"When I hear of a Muslim ruler who deals equitably and rules
			justly, I am happy on his account and I pray for him...
		</p>
		<p>
			"When I hear of rains which fail on the land of Muslims, that
			fills me with happiness..."
		</p>
		<p>
			Abdullah ibn Abbas was constant in his devotions. He kept
			voluntary fasts regularly and often stayed up at night in Prayer.
			He would weep while praying and reading the Quran. And when
			reciting verses dealing with death, resurrection and the life
			hereafter his voice would be heavy from deep sobbing.
		</p>
		<p>
			He passed away at the age of seventy one in the mountainous city
			of Taif.

	<biography name="Ramlah bint Abi Sufyan">
		<p>
			Abu Sufyan ibn Harb could not conceive of anyone among the
			Quraysh who would dare challenge his authority or go against his
			orders. He was after all, the sayyid or chieftain of Makkah who
			had to be obeyed and followed.
		</p>
		<p>
			His daughter, Ramlah, known as Umm Habibah, however dared to
			challenge his authority when she rejected the deities of the
			Quraysh and their idolatrous ways. Together with her husband,
			Ubaydullah ibn Jahsh, she put her faith in Allah alone and
			accepted the message of His prophet, Muhammad ibn Abdullah.
		</p>
		<p>
			Abu Sufyan tried with all the power and force at his disposal to
			bring back his daughter and her husband to his religion and the
			religion of their forefathers. But he did not succeed. The faith
			which was embedded in the heart of Ramlah was too strong to be
			uprooted by the hurricanes of Abu Sufyans fury.
		</p>
		<p>
			Abu Sufyan remained deeply worried and concerned by his
			daughter's acceptance of Islam. He did not know how to face the
			Quraysh after she had gone against his will and he was clearly
			powerless to prevent her from following Muhammad. When the
			Quraysh realized though that Abu Sufyan himself was enraged by
			Ramlah and her husband, they were emboldened to treat them
			harshly. They unleashed the full fury of their persecution
			against them to such a degree that life in Makkah became
			unbearable.
		</p>
		<p>
			In the fifth year of his mission, the Prophet, peace be on him,
			gave permission to the Muslims to migrate to Abyssinia. Ramlah,
			her little daughter Habibah, and her husband were among those who
			left.
		</p>
		<p>
			Abu Sufyan and the Quraysh leaders found it difficult to accept
			that a group of Muslims had slipped out of their net of
			persecution and was enjoying the freedom to hold their beliefs
			and practice their religion in the land of the Negus. They
			therefore send messengers to the Negus to seek their extradition.
			The messengers tried to poison the mind of the Negus against the
			Muslims but after examining the Muslims beliefs and listening to
			the Quran being recited, the Negus concluded: "What has been
			revealed to your Prophet Muhammad and what Jesus the son of Mary
			preached came from the same source."
		</p>
		<p>
			The Negus himself announced his faith in the one true God and his
			acceptance of the prophethood of Muhammad, peace be on him. He
			also announced his determination to protect the Muslim muhajirin.
		</p>
		<p>
			The long journey on the road of hardship and tribulation had
			finally led to the oasis of serenity. So Umm Habibah felt. But
			she did not know that the new-found freedom and sense of peace
			were later to be shattered. She was to be put through a test of
			the most severe and harrowing kind.
		</p>
		<p>
			One night, it is related, as Umm Habibah was asleep she had a
			vision in which she saw her husband in the midst of a fathomless
			ocean covered by wave upon wave of darkness. He was in a most
			perilous situation. She woke up, frightened. But she did not wish
			to tell her husband or anyone else what she had seen.
		</p>
		<p>
			The day after that ominous night was not yet through when
			Ubaydallah ibn Jahsh announced his rejection of Islam and his
			acceptance of Christianity. What a terrible blow! Ramlah's sense
			of peace was shattered. She did not expect this of her husband
			who presented her forthwith with the choice of a divorce or of
			accepting Christianity. Umm Habibah had three options before her.
			She could either remain with her husband and accept his call to
			become a Christian in which case she also would commit apostasy
			and - God forbid - deserve ignominy in this world and punishment
			in the hereafter. This was something she resolved she would never
			do even if she were subjected to the most horrible torture. Or,
			she could return to her father's house in Makkah - but she knew
			he remained a citadel of shirk and she would be forced to live
			under him, subdued and suppressing her faith. Or, she could stay
			alone in the land of the Negus as a displaced fugitive - without
			country, without family and without a supporter.
		</p>
		<p>
			She made the choice that she considered was the most pleasing to
			God. She made up her mind to stay in Abyssinia until such time as
			God granted her relief. She divorced her husband who lived only a
			short while after becoming a Christian. He had given himself over
			to frequenting wine merchants and consuming alcohol, the "mother
			of evils". This undoubtedly helped to destroy him.
		</p>
		<p>
			Umm Habibah stayed in Abyssinia for about ten years. Towards the
			end of this time, relief and happiness came. It came from an
			unexpected quarter.
		</p>
		<p>
			One morning bright and early, there was a loud knocking on her
			door. It was Abrahah, the special maid-servant of the Negus.
			Abrahah was beaming with joy as she greeted Umm Habibah and said:
			"The Negus sends his greetings and says to you that Muhammad, the
			Messenger of God, wants you to marry him and that he has sent a
			letter in which he has appointed him as his wakil to contract the
			marriage between you and him. If you agree, you are to appoint a
			wakil to act on your behalf."
		</p>
		<p>
			Umm Habibah was in the clouds with happiness. She shouted to
			herself: "God has given you glad tidings. God has given you glad
			tidings." She took off her jewelry- her necklace and bracelets -
			and gave them to Abrahah. She took off her rings too and gave
			them to her. And indeed if she had possessed all the treasures of
			the world, she would have given them to Abrahah at that moment of
			sheer joy. Finally she said to Abrahah: "I appoint Khalid ibn
			Said ibn al-Aas to act as wakil on my behalf for he is the
			closest person to me."
		</p>
		<p>
			In the palace of the Negus, set in the midst of beautiful gardens
			and luxuriant vegetation and in one of the lavishly decorated,
			sumptuously furnished and brightly lit halls, the group of
			Muslims living in Abyssinia gathered. They included Jafar ibn Abi
			Talib, Khalid ibn Said, Abdullah ibn Hudhafah as-Sahmi and
			others. They had gathered to witness the conclusion of the
			marriage contract between Umm Habibah, the daughter of Abu
			Sufyan, and Muhammad, the Messenger of God. When the marriage was
			finalized, the Negus addressed the gathering: "I praise God, the
			Holy, and I declare that there is no god but Allah and that
			Muhammad is His Servant and His Messenger and that He gave the
			good tidings to Jesus the son of Mary.
		</p>
		<p>
			"The Messenger of God, peace be on him, has requested me to
			conclude the marriage contract between him and Umm Habibah the
			daughter of Abu Sufyan. I agreed to do what he requested and on
			his behalf I give her a mahr or dowry of four hundred gold
			dinars." He handed over the amount to Khalid ibn Said who stood
			up and said: "All praise is due to God. I praise Him and seek His
			help and forgiveness and I turn to Him in repentance. I declare
			that Muhammad is His servant and His Messenger whom He has sent
			with the religion of guidance and truth so that it might prevail
			over all other forms of religion even if the disbelievers were to
			dislike this.
		</p>
		<p>
			"I have agreed to do what the Prophet, peace be upon him, has
			requested and acted as the wakil on behalf of Umm Habibah, the
			daughter of Abu Sufyan. May God bless His Messenger and his wife.
		</p>
		<p>
			"Congratulations to Umm Habibah on account of the goodness which
			God has ordained for her."
		</p>
		<p>
			Khalid took the mahr and handed it over to Umm Habibah. The
			Sahabah thereupon got up and prepared to leave but the Negus said
			to them: "Sit down for it is the practice of the Prophets to
			serve food at marriages."
		</p>
		<p>
			There was general rejoicing at the court of the Negus as the
			guests sat down again to eat and celebrate the joyous occasion.
			Umm Habibah especially could hardly believe her good fortune and
			she later described how she was eager to share her happiness. She
			said: "When I received the money as mahr, I sent fifty mithqals
			of gold to Abrahah who had brought me the good news and I said to
			her: 'I gave you what I did when you gave me the good news
			because at that time I did not have any money.'
		</p>
		<p>
			"Shortly  afterwards,  Abrahah came to me and returned the gold.
			She also produced a case which contained the necklace I had given
			to her. She returned that to me and said: 'The King has
			instructed me not to take anything from you and he his commanded
			the women in his household to present you with gifts of perfume.'
		</p>
		<p>
			"On the following day, she brought me ambergris, safron and aloes
			and said: 'I have a favor to ask of you.' 'What is it?' I asked.
			'I have accepted Islam ,' she said, 'and now follow the religion
			of Muhammad. Convey to him my salutation of peace and let him
			know that I believe in Allah and His Prophet. Please don't
			forget.' She then helped me to get ready for my journey to the
			Prophet.
		</p>
		<p>
			"When I met the Prophet, peace be on him, I told him all about
			the arrangements that were made for the marriage and about my
			relationship with Abrahah. I told him she had become a Muslim and
			conveyed to him her greetings of peace. He was filled with joy at
			the news and said: 'Wa alayha as-salam wa rahmatullahi was
			barakatuhu and on her be peace and the mercy and blessings of
			God. "

	<biography name="Abdullah Ibn Sailam">
		<p>
			Al-Husayn ibn Sailam was a Jewish rabbi in Yathrib who was widely
			respected and honoured by the people of the city even by those
			who were not Jewish. He was known for his piety and goodness, his
			upright conduct and his truthfulness.
		</p>
		<p>
			Al-Husayn lived a peaceful and gentle life but he was serious,
			purposeful and organized in the way he spent his time. For a
			fixed period each day, he would worship, teach and preach in the
			temple. Then he would spend some time in his orchard, looking
			after date palms, pruning and pollinating. Thereafter, to
			increase his understanding and knowledge of his religion, he
			would devote himself to the study of the Torah.
		</p>
		<p>
			In this study, it is said. he was particularly struck by some
			verses of the Torah which dealt with the coming of a Prophet who
			would complete the message of previous Prophets. Al-Husayn
			therefore took an immediate and keen interest when he heard
			reports of the appearance of a Prophet in Makkah. He said:
		</p>
		<p>
			"When I heard of the appearance of the Messenger of God, peace be
			on him, I began to make enquiries about his name, his genealogy,
			his characteristics, his time and place and I began to compare
			this information with what is contained m our books. From these
			enquiries, I became convinced about the authenticity of his
			prophethood and I affirmed the truth of his mission. However, I
			concealed my conclusions from the Jews. I held my tongue...
		</p>
		<p>
			Then came the day when the Prophet, peace be on him, left Makkah
			and headed for Yathrib. When he reached Yathrib and stopped at
			Quba, a man came rushing into the city, calling out to people and
			announcing the arrival of the Prophet. At that moment, I was at
			the top of a palm tree doing some work. My aunt, Khalidah bint
			al-Harith, was sitting under the tree. On hearing the news, I
			shouted:
		</p>
		<p>
			'Allahu Akbar! Allahu Akbar! (God is Great! God is Great!' When
			my aunt heard my takbir, she remonstrated with me: 'May God
			frustrate you...By God, if you had heard that Moses was coming
			you would not have been more enthusiastic.'
		</p>
		<p>
			'Auntie, he is really, by God, the 'brother' of Moses and follows
			his religion. He was sent with the same mission as Moses.' She
			was silent for a while and then said: 'Is he the Prophet about
			whom you spoke to us who would be sent to confirm the truth
			preached by previous (Prophets) and complete the message of his
			Lord?' 'Yes,' I replied.
		</p>
		<p>
			Without any delay or hesitation, I went out to meet the Prophet.
			I saw crowds of people at his door. I moved about in the crowds
			until I reached close to him. The first words I heard him say
			were:
		</p>
		<p>
			'O people! Spread peace...Share food...Pray during the night
			while people (normally) sleep... and you will enter Paradise in
			peace...'
		</p>
		<p>
			I looked at him closely. I scrutinized him and was convinced that
			his face was not that of an imposter. I went closer to him and
			made the declaration of faith that there is no god but Allah and
			that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah.
		</p>
		<p>
			The Prophet turned to me and asked: 'What is your name?'
			'Al-Husayn ibn Sailam,' I replied.
		</p>
		<p>
			'Instead, it is (now) Abdullah ibn Sallam,' he said (giving me a
			new name). 'Yes,' I agreed. 'Abdullah ibn Sailam (it shall be).
			By Him who has sent you with the Truth, I do not wish to have
			another name after this day.'
		</p>
		<p>
			I returned home and introduced Islam to my wife, my children and
			the rest of my household. They all accepted Islam including my
			aunt KhaIidah who was then an old lady. However, I advised them
			then to conceal our acceptance of Islam from the Jews until I
			gave them permission. They agreed.
		</p>
		<p>
			Subsequently, I went back to the Prophet, peace be on him, and
			said: 'O Messenger of God! The Jews are a people (inclined to)
			slander and falsehood. I want you to invite their most prominent
			men to meet you. (During the meeting however), you should keep me
			concealed from them in one of your rooms. Ask them then about my
			status among them before they find out of my acceptance of Islam.
			Then invite them to Islam. If they were to know that I have
			become a Muslim, they would denounce me and accuse me of
			everything base and slander me.'
		</p>
		<p>
			The Prophet kept me in one of his rooms and invited the prominent
			Jewish personalities to visit him. He introduced Islam to them
			and urged them to have faith in God...They began to dispute and
			argue with him about the Truth. When he realized that they were
			not inclined to accept Islam, he put the question to them:
		</p>
		<p>
			'What is the status of Al-Husayn ibn Sailam among you?'
		</p>
		<p>
			'He is our sayyid (leader) and the son of our sayyid. He is our
			rabbi and our alim (scholar), the son of our rabbi and alim.'
		</p>
		<p>
			'If you come to know that he has accepted Islam, would you accept
			Islam also?' asked the Prophet.
		</p>
		<p>
			'God forbid! He would not accept Islam. May God protect him from
			accepting Islam,' they said (horrified).
		</p>
		<p>
			At this point I came out in full view of them and announced: 'O
			assembly of Jews! Be conscious of God and accept what Muhammad
			has brought. By God, you certainly know that he is the Messenger
			of God and you can find prophecies about him and mention of his
			name and characteristics in your Torah. I for my part declare
			that he is the Messenger of God. I have faith in him and believe
			that he is true. I know him.'
		</p>
		<p>
			'You are a liar,' they shouted. 'By God, you are evil and
			ignorant, the son of an evil and ignorant person.' And they
			continued to heap every conceivable abuse on
		</p>
		<p>
			me..."
		</p>
		<p>
			Abdullah ibn Sailam approached Islam with a soul thirsty for
			knowledge. He was passionately devoted to the Quran and spent
			much time reciting and studying its beautiful and sublime verses.
			He was deeply attached to the noble Prophet and was constantly in
			his company.
		</p>
		<p>
			Much of his time he spent in the masjid, engaged in worship, in
			learning and in teaching. He was known for his sweet, moving and
			effective way of teaching study circles of Sahabah who assembled
			regularly in the Prophet's mosque.
		</p>
		<p>
			Abdullah ibn Sallam was known among the Sahabah as a man from
			ahl-al-Jannah "- the people of Paradise. This was because of his
			determination on the advice of the Prophet to hold steadfastly to
			the "most trustworthy handhold" that is belief in and total
			submission to God.

	<biography name="Muhammad ibn Maslamah">
		<p>
			Black, tall and sturdy, Muhammad ibn Maslamah towered above his
			contemporaries. He was a giant among the companions of the
			Prophet, a giant in body and a giant in deeds.
		</p>
		<p>
			Significantly he was called Muhammad even before he became a
			Muslim. It would seem that his name was itself a pointer to the
			fact that he was among the first of the Yathribites to become a
			Muslim and to follow the teachings of the great Prophet. (The
			name Muhammad was practically unknown at the time but since the
			Prophet encouraged Muslims to name themselves after him, it has
			become one of the most widely used names in the world.)
		</p>
		<p>
			Muhammad ibn Maslamah was a halif or an ally of the Aws tribe in
			Madinah indicating that he himself was not an Arab. He became a
			Muslim at the hands of Musab ibn Umayr, the first missionary sent
			out by the Prophet from Makkah to Madinah. He accepted Islam even
			before men like Usayd ibn Hudayr and Sad ibn Muadh who were
			influential men in the city.
		</p>
		<p>
			When the Prophet, peace be on him, came to Madinah, he adopted
			the unique method of strengthening the bonds of brotherhood
			between the Muhajirin and the Ansar. He paired off each Muhajir
			with one of the Ansar. This arrangement also helped to relieve
			the immediate needs of the Muhajirin for shelter and food and
			created an integrated community of believers.
		</p>
		<p>
			The Prophet was a keen observer of character and temperament and
			was concerned to join in brotherhood persons of similar attitudes
			and tastes. He joined in brotherhood  Muhammad	ibn  Maslamah 
			and  Abu Ubaydah ibn al-Jarrah. Like Abu Ubaydah, Muhammad ibn
			Maslamah was quiet and pensive and had a strong sense of trust
			and devotion. He was also brave and resolute in action. He was a
			distinguished horseman who performed feats of heroism and
			sacrifice in the service of Islam.
		</p>
		<p>
			Muhammad ibn Maslamah took part in all the military engagements
			of the Prophet except the expedition to Tabuk. On that occasion,
			he and Ali were put in charge of an army which was left behind to
			protect Madinah. Later in life, he would often relate scenes of
			these battles to his ten children.
		</p>
		<p>
			There are many instances in the life of Muhammad ibn Maslamah
			which showed what a dependable and trustworthy person he was.
			Before the start of hostilities at the Battle of Uhud, the
			Prophet and the Muslim force numbering some seven hundred persons
			spent a night in an open camp. He put fifty men under the command
			of Muhammad ibn Maslamah and entrusted him with the task of
			patrolling the camp the whole night. During the battle itself,
			after the disastrous rout of the Muslims by the Quraysh during
			which about seventy Muslims lost their lives and many fled in
			every possible direction, a small band of the faithful bravely
			defended the Prophet till the tide of battle turned. Muhammad ibn
			Maslamah was among them.
		</p>
		<p>
			Muhammad ibn Maslamah was quick to respond to the call of action.
			He once stood listening to the Prophet as he spoke to the Muslims
			about the designs of some of the Jewish leaders in the region.
		</p>
		<p>
			At the beginning of his stay in Madinah, the Prophet had
			concluded an agreement with the Jews of the city which said in
			part:
		</p>
		<p>
			"The Jews who attach themselves to our commonwealth shall be
			protected from all insults and harassment. They shall have equal
			rights as our own people to our assistance...They shall join the
			Muslims in defending Madinah against all enemies...They shall not
			declare war nor enter in treaty or agreement against the
			Muslims."
		</p>
		<p>
			Jewish	leaders had violated this agreement by encouraging the
			Quraysh and tribes around Madinah in their designs against the
			state. They were also bent on creating. discord among the people
			of Madinah in order to weaken the influence of Islam.
		</p>
		<p>
			After the resounding victory of the Muslims over the Quraysh at
			the Battle of Badr, one of the three main Jewish groups in
			Madinah, the Banu Qaynuqa was especially furious and issued a
			petulant challenge to the Prophet. They said:
		</p>
		<p>
			"O Muhammad! You really think that we are like your people (the
			Quraysh)? Don't be deceived. You confronted a people who have no
			knowledge of war and you took the chance to rout them. If you
			were to fight against us you would indeed know that we arc men."
		</p>
		<p>
			They thus spurned their agreement with the Prophet and issued an
			open challenge to fight. The Qaynuqa however were goldsmiths who
			dominated the market in Madinah. They were depending on their
			allies, the Khazraj, to help them in their declared war. The
			Khazraj refused. The Prophet placed the Banu Qaynuqa's quarters
			under a siege which lasted for fifteen nights. The fainthearted
			Qaynuqa finally decided to surrender and ask the Prophet for a
			free passage out of Madinah.
		</p>
		<p>
			The Prophet allowed them to leave and the tribe - men, women and
			children - left unharmed. They had to leave behind them their
			arms and their goldsmith's equipment. They settled down at
			Adhraat in Syria.
		</p>
		<p>
			The departure of the Qaynuqa did not end Jewish feelings of
			animosity towards the Prophet although the nonaggression
			agreement was still in force. One of those who was consumed with
			hatred against the Prophet and the Muslims and who openly gave
			vent to his rage was Kab ibn al-Ashraf.
		</p>
		<p>
			Kab's father was in fact an Arab who had fled to Madinah after
			committing a crime. He became an ally of the Banu Nadir, another
			important Jewish group, and married a Jewish lady name Aqilah
			bint Abu-l Haqiq. She was Kab's mother.
		</p>
		<p>
			Kab was a tall and impressive looking person. He was a well-known
			poet and was one of the richest men among the Jews. He lived in a
			castle on the outskirts of Madinah where he had extensive palm
			groves. He was regarded as a Jewish leader of importance
			throughout the Hijaz. He provided means of support and
			sponsorship to many Jewish rabbis.
		</p>
		<p>
			Kab was openly hostile to Islam. He lampooned the Prophet,
			besmirched in verse the reputation of Muslim women, and incited
			the tribes in and around Madinah against the Prophet and Islam.
			He was particularly distressed when he heard the news of the
			Muslim victory at Badr. When he saw the returning army with the
			Quraysh prisoners of war, he was bitter and furious. He took it
			upon himself then to make the long journey to Makkah to express
			his grief and to incite the Quraysh to take further revenge. He
			also went to other areas, from tribe to tribe, urging people to
			take up arms against the Prophet. News of his activities reached
			the Prophet, peace be on him, who prayed: "O Lord, rid me of the
			son of Ashfar, however You wish."
		</p>
		<p>
			Kab had become a real danger to the state of peace and mutual
			trust which the Prophet was struggling to achieve in Madinah.
		</p>
		<p>
			Kab returned to Madinah and continued his verbal attacks on the
			Prophet and his abuse of Muslim women. He refused, after warnings
			from the Prophet, to stop his dirty campaign and sinister
			intrigues. He was bent on fomenting a revolt against the Prophet
			and the Muslims in Madinah. By all these actions, Kab had openly
			declared war against the Prophet. He was dangerous and a public
			enemy to the nascent Muslim state. The Prophet was quite
			exasperated with him and said to the Muslims: "Who will deal with
			Kab ibn al-Ashraf? He has offended God and His Apostle."
		</p>
		<p>
			"I shall deal with him for you, O Messenger of God," volunteered
			Muhammad ibn Maslamah.
		</p>
		<p>
			This, however, was no easy undertaking. Muhammad ibn Maslamah,
			according to one report, went home and stayed for three days
			without either eating or drinking, just thinking about what he
			had to do. The Prophet heard of this, called him and asked him
			why he had not been eating or drinking. He replied: "O Messenger
			of God, I gave an undertaking to you but I do not know whether I
			can accomplish it or not." "Your duty is only to try your
			utmost," replied the Prophet.
		</p>
		<p>
			Muhammad ibn Maslamah then went to some other companions of the
			Prophet and told them what he had undertaken to do. They included
			Abu Nailah, a foster brother of Kab ibn al-Ahsraf. They agreed to
			help him and he devised a plan to accomplish the mission. They
			went back to the Prophet to seek his approval since the plan
			involved enticing Kab from his fortress residence through some
			deception. The Prophet gave his consent on the principle that war
			involved deceit.
		</p>
		<p>
			Both Muhammad ibn Maslamah who was in fact a nephew of Kab by
			fosterage and Abu Nailah then went to Kab's residence. Muhammad
			ibn Maslamah was the first to speak: "This man (meaning the
			Prophet, peace be on him) has asked us for sadaqah (charitable
			tax) and we cannot even find food to eat. He is oppressing us
			with his laws and prohibitions and I thought I could come to you
			to ask for a loan."
		</p>
		<p>
			"By God, I am much more dissatisfied with him," confessed Kab.
			"We have followed him but we do not want to leave him until we
			see how this whole business will end. We would like you to lend
			us a wasaq or two of gold," continued Muhammad ibn Maslamah.
		</p>
		<p>
			"Isn't it about time that you realize what falsehood you are
			tolerating from him? asked Kab as he promised to give them the
			loan. "However," he said, "you must provide security (for the
			loan)."
		</p>
		<p>
			"What security do you want?" they asked. "Give me your wives as
			security," he suggested. "How can we give you our wives as
			security ," they protested, "when you are the most handsome of
			Arabs?"
		</p>
		<p>
			"Then give me your children as security," Kab suggested. "How can
			we give you our children as security when any one of them would
			thereafter be ridiculed by being called a hostage for one or two
			wasaqs of gold. This would be a disgrace to us. But we could give
			you our (means of) protection (meaning weapons) since you know
			that we need them."
		</p>
		<p>
			Kab agreed to this suggestion which they had made to disabuse his
			mind of any notion that they had come armed. They promised to
			come back to him again to bring the weapons.
		</p>
		<p>
			Meanwhile, Abu Nailah also came up to Kab and said: "Woe to you,
			Ibn Ashraf. I have come to you intending to mention something to
			you and you do not encourage me." Kab asked him to go on and Abu
			Nailah said: "The coming of this man to us has been a source of
			affliction to our Arab customs. With one shot he has severed our
			ways and left families hungry and in difficulties. We and our
			families are struggling." Kab replied: "I, Ibn al-Ashraf, by God,
			I had told you, son of Salamah, that the matter would end up as I
			predicted." Abu Nailah replied: "I wish you could sell us some
			food and we would give you whatever form of security and trust
			required. Be good to us. I have friends who share my views on
			this and I want to bring them to you so that you could sell them
			some food and deal well towards them. We will come to you and
			pledge our shields and weapons to you as security." "There is
			loyalty and good faith in weapons," agreed Kab.
		</p>
		<p>
			With this they left promising to return and bring the required
			security for the loan. They went back to the Prophet and reported
			to him what had happened. That night, Muhammad ibn Maslamah, Abu
			Nailah, Abbad ibn Bisnr, Al-Harith ibn Aws and Abu Abasah ibn
			Jabr all set off for Kabs house. The Prophet went with them for a
			short distance and parted with the words:
		</p>
		<p>
			"Go forth in the name of God." And he prayed: "O Lord, help
			them." The Prophet returned home. It was a moonlit night in the
			month of Rabi al-Awwal in the third year of the hijrah.
		</p>
		<p>
			Muhammad ibn Maslamah and the four with him reached Kab's house.
			They called out to him. As he got out of bed, his wife held him
			and warned: "You are a man at war. People at war do not go down
			at such an hour." "It is only my nephew Muhammad ibn Maslamah and
			my foster brother, Abu Nailah..." Kab came down with his sword
			drawn. He was heavily scented with the perfume of musk.
		</p>
		<p>
			"I have not smelt such a pleasant scent as today," greeted
			Muhammad ibn Maslamah. "Let me smell your head." Kab agreed and
			as Muhammad bent over, he grasped Kab's head firmly and called on
			the others to strike down the enemy of God.
		</p>
		<p>
			(Details of this incident vary somewhat. Some reports state that
			it was Abu Nailah who gave the command to strike down Kab and
			this was done after Kab had emerged from his house and walked
			with them for some time. )
		</p>
		<p>
			The elimination of Kab ibn al-Ashraf struck terror into the
			hearts of those, and there were many of them in Madinah, who
			plotted and intrigued against the Prophet. Such open hostility as
			Kab's diminished for a time but certainly did not cease.
		</p>
		<p>
			At the beginning of the fourth year of the hijrah, the Prophet
			went to the Jewish tribe of Banu Nadir on the outskirts of
			Madinah to seek their help on a certain matter. While among them,
			he found out that they were planning to kill him then and there.
			He had to take decisive action. The Banu Nadir had gone too far.
			Straight away, the Prophet went back to the center of the city.
			He summoned Muhammad ibn Maslamah and sent him to inform the Banu
			Nadir that they had to leave Madinah within ten days because of
			their treacherous behavior and that any one of them seen after
			that in the city would forfeit his life.
		</p>
		<p>
			One can just imagine Muhammad ibn Maslamah addressing the Banu
			Nadir. His towering stature and his loud and clear voice combined
			to let the Banu Nadir know that the Prophet meant every word he
			said and that they had to stand the consequences of their
			treacherous acts. The fact that the Prophet chose Muhammad ibn
			Maslamah for the task is a tribute to his loyalty, courage and
			firmness.
		</p>
		<p>
			Further details of the expulsion of the Banu Nadir from Madinah
			do not concern us here: their plan to resist the Prophet with
			outside help; the Prophet's siege of their district and their
			eventual surrender and evacuation mainly to Khaybar in the north.
			Two of the Banu Nadir though became MusIims - Yamin ibn Umayr and
			Abu Sad ibn Wahb. Ali this happened exactly one year after the
			elimination of Kab ibn al-Ashraf.
		</p>
		<p>
			Both during the time of the Prophet and after, Muhammad ibn
			Maslamah was known for carrying out any assignment he accepted
			exactly as he was ordered, neither doing more nor less than he
			was asked to do. It was these qualities which made Umar choose
			him as one of his ministers and as a trusted friend and guide.
		</p>
		<p>
			When Amr ibn al-Aas requested reinforcements during his
			expedition to Egypt, Umar sent him four detachments of one
			thousand men each. Leading these detachments were Muhammad ibn
			Maslamah, az-Zubayr ibn aI-Awwam, Ubadah ibn as-Samit and
			al-Miqdad ibn al-Aswad. To Amr, Umar sent a message saying, "Let
			me remind you that I am sending Muhammad ibn Maslamah to you to
			help you distribute your wealth. Accommodate him and forgive any
			harshness of his towards you."
		</p>
		<p>
			Ibn Maslamah went to Amr in Fustat (near present-day Cairo).. He
			sat at his table but did not touch the food. Amr asked him: "Did
			Umar prevent you from tasting my food?" "No," replied ibn
			Maslamah, "he did not prevent me from having your food but
			neither did he command me to eat of it." He then placed a flat
			loaf of bread on the table and ate it with salt. Amr became upset
			and said: "May God bring to an end the time in which we work for
			Umar ibn al-Khattab! I have witnessed a time when al-Khattab and
			his son Umar were wandering around wearing clothes which could
			not even cover them properly while Al-Aas ibn Wail (Amr's father)
			sported brocade lined with gold..."
		</p>
		<p>
			"As for your father and the father of Umar, they are in hell,"
			retorted Muhammad ibn Maslamah, because they did not accept
			Islam. "As for you, if Umar did not give you an appointment, you
			would have been pleased with what you got from their udders,"
			continued Ibn Maslamah obviously disabusing Amr's mind of any
			ideas he might have of appearing superior because he was the
			governor of Egypt.
		</p>
		<p>
			"Assemblies must be conducted as a form of trust," said Amr in an
			attempt to diffuse the situation and Muhammad ibn Maslamah
			replied: "Oh yes, so long as Umar is alive." He wanted to impress
			upon people the justice of Umar and the egalitarian teachings of
			Islam. Muhammad ibn Maslamah was a veritable scourge against all
			arrogant and haughty behavior.
		</p>
		<p>
			On another occasion and at another end of the Muslim state under
			his caliphate, Umar heard that the famous Sad ibn Abi Waqqas was
			building a palace at Kufa. Umar sent Muhammad ibn Maslamah to
			deal with the situation. On reaching Kufa, Muhammad promptly
			burnt the palace down. One does not know whether people were more
			surprised by the instructions of Umar or by the humiliation of
			Sad ibn Abi Waqqas, the famed fighter, conqueror at Qadisiyyah,
			and the one praised by the Prophet himself for his sacrifices at
			Uhud.
		</p>
		<p>
			Sad did not say a word. This was all part of the great process of
			self-criticism and rectification which helped to make Islam
			spread and establish it on foundations of justice and piety.
		</p>
		<p>
			Muhammad ibn Maslamah served Umar's successor, Uthman ibn Allan,
			faithfully. When, however, the latter was killed and civil war
			broke out among the Muslims, Muhammad ibn Maslamah did not
			participate. The sword which he always used and which was given
			to him by the Prophet himself he deliberately broke. During the
			time of the Prophet, he was known as the "Knight of the Prophet".
			By refusing to use the sword against Muslims he preserved this
			reputation undiminished.
		</p>
		<p>
			Subsequently, he made a sword from wood and fashioned it well. He
			placed it in a scabbard and hung it inside his house. When he was
			asked about it he said: "I simply hang it there to terrify
			people." Muhammad ibn Maslamah died in Madinah in the month of
			Safar in the year 46 AH. He was seventy seven years old.

	<biography name="Nuaym ibn Masud">
		<p>
			Nuaym ibn Masud was from Najd in the northern highlands of
			Arabia. He belonged to the powerful Ghatafan tribe. As a young
			man, he was clever and alert. He was full of enterprise and
			travelled widely. He was resourceful, every ready to take up a
			challenge and not prepared to allow any problem to get the better
			of him.
		</p>
		<p>
			This son of the desert was endowed with extraordinary presence of
			mind and unusual subtlety. He was however someone who liked to
			enjoy himself and gave himself over to the pursuit of youthful
			passions. He loved music and took delight in the company of
			songstresses. Often when he felt the urge to listen to the
			strings of a musical instrument or to enjoy the company of a
			singer, he would leave the hearths of his people in the Najd and
			make his way to Yathrib and in particular to the Jewish community
			which was widely known for its song and music.
		</p>
		<p>
			While in Yathrib, Nuaym was known to spend generously and he in
			turn would be lavishly entertained. In this way Nuaym came to
			develop strong links among the Jews of the city and in particular
			with the Banu Qurayzah.
		</p>
		<p>
			At the time when God favored mankind by sending His Prophet with
			the religion of guidance and truth and the valleys of Makkah
			glowed with the light of Islam, Nuaym ibn Masud was still given
			over to the pursuit of sensual satisfaction. He stopped firmly
			opposed to the religion partly out of fear that he would be
			obliged to change and give up his pursuit of pleasure. And it was
			not long before he found himself being drawn into joining the
			fierce opposition to Islam and waging war against the Prophet and
			his companions.
		</p>
		<p>
			The moment of truth for Nuaym came during the great siege of
			Madinah which took place in the fifth year of the Prophet's stay
			in the city. We need to go back a little to pick up the threads
			of the story.
		</p>
		<p>
			Two years before the siege, the Prophet was compelled to banish a
			group of Jews belonging to the tribe of Banu an-Nadir from
			Madinah because of their collaboration with the Quraysh enemy.
			The Banu Nadir migrated to the north and settled in Khaybar and
			other oases along the trade route to Syria. They at once began to
			incite the tribes both near and far against the Muslims. Caravans
			going to Madinah were harassed partly to put economic pressure on
			the city.
		</p>
		<p>
			But this was not enough. Leaders of the Banu an-Nadir got
			together and decided to form a mighty alliance or confederacy of
			as many tribes as possible to wage war on the Prophet, and to put
			an end once and for all to his mission. The Nadirites went to the
			Quraysh in Makkah and urged them to continue the fight against
			the Muslims. They made a pact with the Quraysh to attack Madinah
			at a specified time.
		</p>
		<p>
			After Makkah, the Nadirite leaders set out northwards on a
			journey of some one thousand kilometers to meet the Ghatafan.
			They promised the Ghatafan the entire annual date harvest of
			Khaybar for waging war against Islam and its Prophet. They
			informed the Ghatafan of the pact they had concluded with the
			Quraysh and persuaded them to make a similar agreement.
		</p>
		<p>
			Other tribes were also persuaded to join the mighty alliance.
			From the north came the Banu Asad and the Fazar. From the south
			the Ahabish, allies of the Quraysh, the Banu Sulaym and others.
			At the appointed time, the Quraysh set out from Makkah in large
			numbers on cavalry and on foot under the Leadership of Abu Sufyan
			ibn Harb. The Ghatafan too set out from Najd in large numbers
			under the leadership of Ubaynah ibn Hisn. In the vanguard of the
			Ghatafan army was Nuaym ibn Masud.
		</p>
		<p>
			News of the impending attack on Madinah reached the Prophet while
			he was half-way on a long expedition to Dumat al-Jandal on the
			Syrian border some fifteen days journey from Madinah. The tribe
			at Dumat al-Jandal was molesting caravans bound for Madinah and
			their action was probably prompted by the Banu an-Nadir to entice
			the Prophet away from Madinah. With the Prophet away, they
			reasoned, it would be easier for the combined tribal forces from
			the north and the south to attack Madinah and deal a mortal blow
			to the Muslim community with the help of disaffected persons from
			within the city itself.
		</p>
		<p>
			The Prophet Muhammad, peace be upon him, hurried back to Madinah
			and conferred with the Muslims. The forces of the Ahzab or the
			confederate enemy tribes amounted to over ten thousand men while
			the Muslims fighting were just three thousand men. It was
			unanimously decided to defend the city from within and to prepare
			for a siege rather than fight in the open. The Muslims were in
			dire straits.
		</p>
		<p>
			"When they came upon you from above and from below you, and when
			eyes grew wild and hearts reached to the throats. and you were
			imagining vain thoughts concerning God. Then were the believers
			sorely tried and shaken with a mighty shock." (The Quran, Surah
			al-Ahzab, 33:1O)
		</p>
		<p>
			To protect the city, the Muslims decided to dig a ditch or
			khandaq. It is said that the ditch was about three and a half
			miles long and some ten yards wide and five yards deep. The three
			thousand Muslims were divided into groups of ten and each group
			was given a fixed number of cubits to dig. The digging of the
			ditch took several weeks to complete.
		</p>
		<p>
			The ditch was just completed when the mighty enemy forces from
			the north and the south converged on Madinah. While they were
			within a short distance from the city the Nadirire conspirators
			approached their fellow Jews of the Banu Qur~yzah who lived in
			Madinah and tried to persuade them to join the war against the
			Prophet by helping the two armies approaching from Makkah and the
			north. The response of the Qurayzah Jews to the Nadirite leaders
			was: "You have indeed called us to participate in something which
			we like and desire to have accomplished. But you know there is a
			treaty between us and Muhammad binding us to keep the peace with
			him so long as we live secure and content in Madinah. You do
			realize that our pact with him is still valid. We are afraid that
			if Muhammad is victorious in this war he would then punish us
			severely and that he would expel us from Madinah as a result of
			our treachery towards him."
		</p>
		<p>
			The Nadirire leaders however continued to pressurize the Banu
			Qurayzah to renege on their treaty. Treachery to Muhammad, they
			affirmed, was a good and necessary act. They assured the Banu
			Qurayzah that there was no doubt this time that the Muslims would
			be completely routed and Muhammad would be finished once and for
			all.
		</p>
		<p>
			The approach of the two mighty armies strengthened the resolve of
			the Banu Qurayzah to disavow their treaty with Muhammad. They
			tore up the pact and declared their support for the confederates.
			The news fell on the Muslims ears with the force of a
			thunderbolt.
		</p>
		<p>
			The confederate armies were now pressing against Madinah. They
			effectively cut off the city and prevented food and provisions
			and any form of outside help or reinforcement from reaching the
			inhabitants of the city. After the terrible exhaustions of the
			past months the Prophet now felt as if they had fallen between
			the jaws of the enemy. The Quraysh and [he Ghatafan were
			besieging the city from without. The Banu Qurayzah were laying in
			wait behind the Muslims, ready to pounce from within the city.
			Added to this. the hypocrites of Madinah, those who had openly
			professed Islam but remained secretly opposed to the Prophet and
			his mission, began to come out openly and cast doubt and ridicule
			on the Prophet.
		</p>
		<p>
			"Muhammad promised us." they said, "that we would gain possession
			of the treasures of Chosroes and Caesar and here we are today
			with not d single one of us being able to guarantee that he could
			go to the toilet safely to relieve himself!"
		</p>
		<p>
			Thereafter, group after group of the inhabitants of Madinah began
			to disassociate themselves from the Prophet expressing fear for
			their women and children and for their homes should the Banu
			Qurayzah attack once the fighting began. The enemy forces though
			vastly superior in numbers were confounded by the enormous ditch.
			They had never seen or heard of such a military stratagem among
			the Arabs. Nonetheless they tightened their siege of the city. At
			the same time they attempted to breach the ditch at some narrow
			points but were repulsed by the vigilant Muslims. So hard-pressed
			were the Muslims that the Prophet Muhammad and his companions
			once did not even have time for Salat and the Zuhr, Asr, Maghrib
			and Isha prayers had to be performed during the night.
		</p>
		<p>
			As the siege wore on and the situation became more critical for
			the Muslims. Muhammad turned fervently to his Lord for succour
			and support.
		</p>
		<p>
			"O Allah," he prayed, "I beseech you to grant Your promise of
			victory. O Allah I beseech You to grant your promise of victory."
		</p>
		<p>
			On that night, as the Prophet prayed, Nuaym lay tossing in his
			bivouac. He could not sleep. He kept gazing at the stars in the
			vast firmament above. He thought hard and long and suddenly he
			found himself exclaiming and asking: "Woe to you, Nuaym! What is
			it really that has brought you from those far off places in Najd
			to fight this man and those with him? Certainly you are not
			fighting him for the triumph of right or for the protection of
			some honor violated. Really you have only come here to fight for
			some unknown reason. Is it reasonable that someone with a mind
			such as yours should fight and kill or be killed for no cause
			whatsoever? Woe to you, Nuaym. What is it that has caused you to
			draw your sword against this righteous man who exhorts his
			followers to justice, good deeds and helping relatives? And what
			is it that has driven you to sink your spear into the bodies of
			his followers who follow the message of guidance and truth that
			he brought?"
		</p>
		<p>
			Nuaym thus struggled with his conscience and debated with
			himself. Then he came to a decision. Suddenly he stood upright,
			determined. The doubts were gone. Under the cover of darkness, he
			slipped away from the camp of his tribe and made his way to the
			Prophet of God, peace and blessings of Allah be on him.
		</p>
		<p>
			When the Prophet beheld him, standing erect in his presence, he
			exclaimed, "Nuaym ibn Masud?"
		</p>
		<p>
			"Yes, O Messenger of God," declared Nuaym. "What has brought you
			here at this hour?"
		</p>
		<p>
			"I came", said Nuaym, "to declare that there is no god but Allah
			and that you are the servant of God and His Messenger and that
			the message you have brought is
		</p>
		<p>
			He went on: "I have declared my submission to God, O Messenger of
			God, but my people do not know of my submission. Command me
			therefore to do whatever you desire."
		</p>
		<p>
			"You are only one person among us," observed the Prophet. "So go
			to your people and act as if you have nothing to do with us for
			indeed war is treachery."
		</p>
		<p>
			"Yes, O Messenger of God," replied Nuaym. And if God wills, you
			shall witness what pleases you." Without losing any time, Nuaym
			went to the Banu Qurayzah. He was, as was mentioned earlier, a
			close friend of the tribe. "O Bani Qurayzah," he said. "You have
			known my love for you and my sincerity in advising you."
		</p>
		<p>
			"Yes ," they agreed, "but what are you suspicious of so
		</p>
		<p>
			far as we are concerned?" Nuaym continued: "The Quraysh and the
			Ghatafan have their own interests in this war which are different
			from your interests." "How so?" they queried.
		</p>
		<p>
			"This is your city," Nuaym asserted. "You have your wealth, your
			children and your womenfolk here and it is not in your power to
			flee and take refuge in another city. On the other hand, the
			Quraysh and the Ghatafan have their land, their wealth, their
			children and their womenfolk away from this city. They came to
			fight Muhammad. They urged you to break the treaty you had with
			him and to help them against him. So you responded positively to
			them. If they were to be victorious in their encounter with him,
			they would reap the booty. But if they fail to subdue him, they
			would return to their country safe and sound and they would leave
			you to him and he would be in a position to exact the most bitter
			revenge on you. You know very well that you would have no power
			to confront him."
		</p>
		<p>
			"You are right," they said. "But what suggestion do you have?"
			"My opinion," Nuaym suggested, "is that you should not join
			forces with them until you take a group of their prominent men as
			hostages. In that way you could carry on the fight against
			Muhammad either till victory or till the last of your men or
			theirs perish. (They would not be able to leave you in the
			lurch)." "You have advised well," they responded and agreed to
			take up his suggestion.
		</p>
		<p>
			Nuaym then left and went to Abu Sufyan ibn Harb, the Quraysh
			leader and spoke to him and other Quraysh leaders. "O Quraysh,"
			said Nuaym, "You know my affection for you and my enmity towards
			Muhammad. I have heard some news and I thought it my duty to
			disclose it to you but you should keep it confidential and do not
			attribute it to me"
		</p>
		<p>
			"You must inform us of this matter," insisted the Quraysh.
		</p>
		<p>
			Nuaym continued: "The Banu Qurayzah now regret that they have
			agreed to participate in the hostilities against Muhammad. They
			fear that you would turn back and abandon them to him. So they
			have sent a message to Muhammad saying: 'We are sorry for what we
			have done and we are determined to return to the treaty and a
			state of peace with you. Would it please you then if we take
			several Quraysh and Ghatafan nobles and surrender them to you? We
			will then join you in fighting them - the Quraysh and the
			Ghatafan - until you finish them off.' The Prophet has sent back
			a reply to them saying he agrees. If therefore the Jews send a
			delegation to you demanding hostages from among your men do not
			hand over a single person to them. And do not mention a word of
			what I said to you."
		</p>
		<p>
			"What a good ally you are. May you be rewarded well ," said Abu
			Sufyan gratefully.
		</p>
		<p>
			Nuaym then went to his own people the Ghatafan, and spoke to them
			in a similar vein. He gave them the same warning against expected
			treachery from the Banu Qurayzah.
		</p>
		<p>
			Abu Sufyan wanted to test the Banu Qurayzah so he sent his son to
			them. "My father sends greetings of peace to you," began Abu
			Sufyan's son. "He says that our siege of Muhammad and his
			companions has been a protracted affair and we have become
			weary...We are now determined to fight Muhammad and finish him
			off. My father has sent me to you to ask you to join battle with
			Muhammad tomorrow."
		</p>
		<p>
			"But tomorrow is Saturday," said the Jews of Banu Qurayzah, "and
			we do not work at all on Saturdays. Moreover, we would not fight
			with you until you hand over to us seventy of your nobles and
			nobles from the Ghatafan as hostages. We fear that if the
			fighting becomes too intense for you would hasten back home and
			leave us alone to Muhammad. You know that we have no power to
			resist him..."
		</p>
		<p>
			When Abu Sufyan's son returned to his people and told them what
			he had heard from the Banu Qurayzah, they shouted in unison!
		</p>
		<p>
			"Damned be the sons of monkeys and swine! By God, if they were to
			demand from us a single sheep as a hostage, we would not give
			them".
		</p>
		<p>
			And so it was that Nuaym was successful in causing disharmony
			among the confederates and splitting their ranks.
		</p>
		<p>
			While the mighty alliance was in this state of disarray, God sent
			down on the Quraysh and their allies a fierce and bitterly cold
			wind which swept their tents and their vessels away, extinguished
			their fires, buffeted their faces and cast sand in their eves. In
			this terrible state of confusion the allies fled under cover of
			darkness.
		</p>
		<p>
			That very night the Prophet had sent one his companions, Hudayfah
			ibn al-Yaman, to get information on the enemy's morale and
			intentions. He brought back the news that on the advice and
			initiative of Abu Sufyan, the enemy had turned on their heels and
			fled... The news quickly spread through the Muslims ranks and
			they shouted in joy and relief!
		</p>
		<p>
			La ilaha ilia Allahu wahdah

			Sadaqa wadah

		<p>
			Wa nasara abdah

			His forces He has strengthened
		</p>
		<p>
			And Alone the confederates He has destroyed.
		</p>
		<p>
			The Prophet, peace be upon him, praised and gave thanks to his
			Lord for His deliverance from the threat posed by the mighty
			alliance. Nuaym, as a result of his subtle but major role in the
			blasting of the alliance, gained the confidence of the Prophet
			who entrusted him thereafter with many a difficult task. He
			became the standard-bearer of the Prophet on several occasions.
		</p>
		<p>
			Three years after the Battle of the Ditch, on the day the Muslims
			marched victoriously into Makkah, Abu Sufyan ibn Harb stood
			surveying the Muslim armies. He beheld
		</p>
		<p>
			a man carrying the Ghatafan flag and asked: "Who is this?" "Nuaym
			ibn Masud," came the reply.
		</p>
		<p>
			"He did a terrible thing to us at al-Khandaq," Abu Sufyan
			confessed. "By God, he was certainly one of the fiercest enemies
			of Muhammad and here he is now carrying his people's flag in the
			ranks of Muhammad and coming to wage war on us under his
			leadership."
		</p>
		<p>
			Through the grace of God and the magnanimity of the noble
			Prophet, Abu Sufyan himself was soon to join the same ranks.

			It was the fourth year after the Hijrah. The city of the Prophet
			was still under threat from within and without. From within. the
			influential Jewish tribe. the Banu anNadir. broke their agreement
			with the Prophet and made plans to kill him. For this, they were
			banished from the city. This was in the month of Safar.
		</p>
		<p>
			Two months of uneasy quiet passed. Then the Prophet received news
			that tribes from distant Najd were planning an attack. To
			pre-empt them. the Prophet gathered a force of over four hundred
			men. and leaving one of his companions Uthman ibn Allan. in
			charge of the city, set out eastwards. Among this force was the
			young Madinan, Abbad ibn Bishr.
		</p>
		<p>
			Arriving at Najd, the Prophet found the habitations of the
			hostile tribes strangely deserted of men. Only women were about.
			The men had taken to the hills. Some of them regrouped and
			prepared to fight. The time of Salat al-Asr (the afternoon
			prayer) came. The Prophet feared that the hostile tribesmen would
			attack them during prayer. He arranged the Muslims in ranks and
			divided them into two groups and performed the prayer as the
			Salat al-Khawf (the Prayer of Fear). With one group he performed
			one rakah while the other group stood on guard. For the second
			rakah the groups changed places. Each group completed its prayer
			with one rakah after the Prophet had finished...
		</p>
		<p>
			On beholding the disciplined ranks of the Muslims the hostile
			tribesmen became uneasy and afraid. The Prophet had made his
			presence felt and something of his mission was now known at first
			hand in the central highlands of Arabia whence he departed
			peacefully.
		</p>
		<p>
			On the way back, the Prophet pitched camp in a valley for a
			night. As soon as the Muslims had settled their camel mounts, the
			Prophet peace be on him, asked: "Who will be our guard tonight?"
			"We, O Messenger of God," said Abbad ibn Bishr and Ammar ibn
			Yasir both of whom had been paired off as 'brothers' by the
			Prophet when he arrived in Madinah after the Hijrah.
		</p>
		<p>
			Abbad and Ammar left for the mouth of the valley to take up duty.
			Abbad saw that his "brother" was tired and asked him: "What part
			of the night do you wish to sleep, the first or the second?" "I
			shall sleep during the first part," said Ammar who was soon fast
			asleep quite close to Abbad.
		</p>
		<p>
			The night was clear, calm and peaceful. The stars, the trees, and
			the rocks all appeared to celebrate in silence the praises of
			their Lord. Abbad felt serene. There was no movement, no
			threatening sign. Why not spend the time in ibadah (worship) and
			reciting the Quran? How delightful it would be to combine the
			performance of Salat with the measured recitation of the Quran
			which he so much enjoyed.
		</p>
		<p>
			In fact Abbad was enthralled by the Quran from the moment he
			first heard it being recited by the mellow and beautiful voice of
			Musab ibn Umayr. That was before the Hijrah when Abbad was just
			about fifteen years old. The Quran had found a special place in
			his heart and day and night thereafter he would be heard
			repeating the glorious words of God so much so that he became
			known among the Prophet's companions as the "friend of the
			Quran".
		</p>
		<p>
			Late at night, the Prophet once stood up to perform the Tahajjud
			Prayer in Aishah's house which adjoined the masjid. He heard a
			voice reciting the Quran, pure and sweet and as fresh as when the
			angel Jibril revealed the words to him. He asked: "Aishah, is
			that the voice of Abbad ibn Bishr?" "Yes, O Messenger of God,"
			replied Aishah. "O Lord, forgive him," prayed the Prophet out of
			love for him.
		</p>
		<p>
			And so in the stillness of the night, at the mouth of the valley
			in Najd, Abbad stood up and faced the Qiblah. Raising his hand in
			surrender to God, he entered into the state of Prayer. Finishing
			the compulsory opening chapter of the Quran, he began reciting
			Surah al-Kahf in his sweet, captivating voice. Surah al-Kahf is a
			long Surah of one hundred and ten verses which deals in part with
			the virtues of faith, truth and patience and with the relativity
			of time.
		</p>
		<p>
			While he was thus absorbed in reciting and reflecting upon the
			divine words, eternal words of illumination and wisdom, a
			stranger stalked the outskirts of the valley in search of
			Muhammad and his followers. He was one of those who had planned
			to attack the Prophet but who had fled into the mountains on the
			approach of the MusIims. His wife whom he had left in the village
			had been taken as a hostage by one of the Muslims. When he
			eventually found that his wife was gone, he swore by al-Lat and
			al-Uzzah that he would pursue Muhammad and his companions and
			that he would not return unless he had drawn blood.
		</p>
		<p>
			From a distance, the man saw the figure of Abbad silhouetted at
			the mouth of the valley and he knew that the Prophet and his
			followers must be inside the valley. Silently he drew his bow and
			let fly an arrow. Unerringly it embedded itself in Abbad's flesh.
		</p>
		<p>
			Calmly, Abbad pulled out the arrow from his body and went on with
			his recitation, still absorbed in his Salat. The attacker shot a
			second and a third arrow both of which also found their mark.
			Abbad pulled out one and then the other. He finished his
			recitation, made ruku and then sujud. Weak and in pain, he
			stretched out his right hand while still in prostration and shook
			his sleeping companion. Ammar awoke. Silently, Abbad continued
			the Salat to its end and then said: "Get up and stand guard in my
			place. I have been wounded."
		</p>
		<p>
			Ammar jumped up and began to yell. Seeing them both the attacker
			fled into the darkness. Ammar turned to Abbad as he lay on the
			ground, blood flowing from his wounds.
		</p>
		<p>
			"Ya Subhanallah (Glory be to God)! Why didn't you wake me when
			you were hit by the first arrow?" "I was in the midst of reciting
			verses of the Quran which filled my soul with awe and I did not
			want to cut short the recitation. The Prophet had commanded me to
			commit this surah to memory. Death would have been dearer to me
			than that the recitation of this surah should be interrupted."
		</p>
		<p>
			Abbad's devotion to the Quran was a sign of his intense devotion
			to and love for God, His Prophet and His religion. The qualities
			he was known for were his constant immersion in ibadah, his
			heroic courage and his generosity in the path of God. At times of
			sacrifice and death, he would always be in the front line. When
			it was time for receiving his share of rewards, he would only be
			found after much effort and difficulty. He was always trustworthy
			in his dealings with the wealth of Muslims. Ali this was
			recognized. Aishah, the wife of the Prophet, once said: "There
			are three persons among the Ansar whom no one could excel in
			virtue: Sad ibn Muadh, Usayd ibn Khudayr and Abbad ibn Bishr."
		</p>
		<p>
			Abbad died the death of a shahid (martyr) at the battle of
			Yamamah. Just before the battle he had a strong presentiment of
			death and martyrdom. He noticed that there was a lack of mutual
			confidence among the Muhajirin and Ansar. He was grieved and
			upset. He realized that there would be no success for the Muslims
			in these terrible battles unless the Muhajirin and Ansar were
			grouped in separate regiments so that it could be clearly seen
			who really bore their responsibility and who were truly steadfast
			in combat.
		</p>
		<p>
			At the break of day when the battle commenced, Abbad ibn Bishr
			stood on a mound and shouted:
		</p>
		<p>
			"O Ansar, distinguish yourselves among men. Destroy your
			scabbards. And do not forsake Islam."
		</p>
		<p>
			Abbad harangued the Ansar until about four hundred men gathered
			around him at the head of whom were Thabit ibn Qays, al-Baraa ibn
			Malik and Abu Dujanah, the keeper of the Prophet's sword. With
			this force, Abbad unleashed an offensive into the enemy's ranks
			which blunted their thrust and drove them back to the "garden of
			death".
		</p>
		<p>
			At the walls of this garden, Abbad ibn Bishr fell. So numerous
			were his wounds, he was hardly recognizable. He had lived, fought
			and died as a believer.

		<p>
			He grew up in a home filled with the fragrance of iman, and in a
			family where everyone was imbued with the spirit of sacrifice.
			Habib's father, Zayd ibn Asim, was one of the first persons in
			Yathrib to accept Islam and his mother, the celebrated Nusaybah
			bint Kab known as Umm Ammarah, was the first woman to bear arms
			in defence of Islam and in support of the blessed Prophet.
		</p>
		<p>
			Habib, still at a tender age, was privileged to go with his
			mother, father, maternal aunt and brother to Makkah with the
			pioneering group of seventy five who pledged fealty to the
			Prophet at Aqabah and played a decisive role in shaping the early
			history of Islam.
		</p>
		<p>
			At Aqabah, in the darkness of the night, the young Habib
			stretched out his small hand and pledged loyalty to the Prophet.
			From that day, the Prophet, peace and blessings of God on him,
			became dearer to Habib than his own mother or father and Islam
			became more important to him than any care for his personal
			safety.
		</p>
		<p>
			Habib did not participate in the Battle of Badr because he was
			too young. Neither did he have the opportunity to take part in
			the battle of Uhud because he was still considered too young to
			bear arms. Thereafter, however, he took part in all the
			engagements which the Prophet fought and in all he distinguished
			himself by his bravery and willingness to sacrifice. Although
			each of these battles had its own importance and was demanding in
			its own way, they served to prepare Habib for what was to prove
			the most terrible encounter of his life, the violence of which is
			profoundly soul-shaking.
		</p>
		<p>
			Let us follow this awesome story from the beginning. By the ninth
			year after the Hijrah, Islam had spread widely and had become the
			dominant force in the Arabian peninsula. Delegations of tribes
			from all over the land converged on Makkah to meet the Messenger
			of God, peace be upon him, and announce before him, their
			acceptance of Islam.
		</p>
		<p>
			Among these delegations was one from the highlands of Najd, from
			the Banu Hanilab. At the outskirts of Makkah, the members of the
			delegation tethered their mounts and appointed Musaylamah ibn
			Habib as their spokesman and representative. Musaylamah went to
			the Prophet, peace be upon him. and announced his people's
			acceptance of Islam. The Prophet welcomed them and treated  them 
			most generously.  Each, including Musaylamah, was presented with
			a gift.
		</p>
		<p>
			On his return to Najd the ambitious and self-seeking Musaylamah
			recanted and gave up his allegiance to the Prophet. He stood
			among the people and proclaimed that a prophet had been sent by
			God to the Banu Hanifah just as God had sent Muhammad ibn
			Abdullah to the Quraysh.
		</p>
		<p>
			For various reasons and under a variety of pressures, the Banu
			Hanilab began to rally around him. Most followed him out of
			tribal loyalty or asabiyyah. Indeed one member of the tribe
			declared: "I testify that Muhammad is indeed truthful and that
			Musaylamah is indeed an imposter. But the imposter of Rabiah (the
			tribal confederation to which the Banu Hanilab belonged) is
			dearer to me that the genuine and truthful person from Mudar (the
			tribal confederation to which the Quraysh belonged)."
		</p>
		<p>
			Before long, the number of Musaylamah's followers increased and
			he felt powerful, powerful enough to write the following letter
			to the Prophet, peace be upon him: "From Musaylamah, the
			messenger of God to Muhammad, the messenger of God. Peace be on
			you. I am prepared to share this mission with you. I shall have
			(control over) half the land and you shall have the other half.
			But the Quraysh are an aggressive people."
		</p>
		<p>
			Musaylamah despatched two of his men with the letter to the
			Prophet. When the letter was read to the Prophet, he asked the
			two men: "And what do you yourselves say about this matter?" "We
			affirm what the letter says," they replied. "By God," said the
			Prophet, "were it not for the fact that emissaries are not killed
			I would have smitten both your necks." He then wrote to
			Musaylamah: "In the name of God, the Beneficent, the
			Compassionate. From  Muhammad  the  Messenger of God,  to
			Musaylamah the imposter.
		</p>
		<p>
			Peace be upon whoever follows the guidance. God will bequeath the
			earth to whosoever of His servants He wishes and the final
			triumph will be for those who are careful of their duty to God."
			He sent the letter with the two men.
		</p>
		<p>
			Musaylamah's evil and corrupting influence continued to spread
			and the Prophet considered it necessary to send another letter to
			him inviting him to abandon his misguided ways. The Prophet chose
			Habib ibn Zayd to take this letter to Musaylamah. Habib was by
			this time in the prime of his youth and a firm believer in the
			truth of Islam with every fibre of his being.
		</p>
		<p>
			Habib undertook his mission eagerly and proceeded as quickly as
			he could to the highlands of the Najd, the territory of the Banu
			Hanilab. He presented the letter to Musaylamah.
		</p>
		<p>
			Musaylamah was convulsed with bitter rage. His face was terrible
			to behold. He ordered Habib to be put in chains and to be brought
			back before him the following day.
		</p>
		<p>
			On the following day, Musaylamah presided over his assembly. On
			his right and on his left were his senior advisers, there to
			further his evil cause. The common people were allowed to enter.
			He then ordered Habib, shackled in his chains, to be brought
			before him.
		</p>
		<p>
			Habib stood in the midst of this crowded, hate-filled gathering.
			He remained upright, dignified and proud like a sturdy spear
			firmly implanted in the ground, unyielding.
		</p>
		<p>
			Musaylamah turned to him and asked: "Do you testify that Muhammad
			is the Messenger of God?" "Yes," Habib replied. "I testify that
			Muhammad is the Messenger of God."
		</p>
		<p>
			Musaylamah was visibly angry. "And do you testify that I am the
			Messenger of God?" He was almost insisting, rather than
			questioning. "My ears have been blocked against hearing what you
			claim," replied Habib.
		</p>
		<p>
			Musaylamah's face changed color, his lips trembled in anger and
			he shouted to his executioner, "Cut off a piece of his body."
		</p>
		<p>
			With sword in hand, the menacing executioner advanced towards
			Habib and severed one of his limbs.
		</p>
		<p>
			Musaylamah then put the same question to him once more and
			Habib's answers were the same. He affirmed his belief in Muhammad
			as the Messenger of God and at the expense of his own life he
			refused to acknowledge the messengership of any other. Musaylamah
			thereupon ordered his henchman to cut off another part of Habib's
			body. This fell to the ground beside the other severed limb. The
			people looked on in amazement at Habib's composure and
			steadfastness.
		</p>
		<p>
			Faced with Musaylamah's persistent questioning and the terrible
			blows of his henchman, Habib kept on repeating:
		</p>
		<p>
			"I testify that Muhammad is the Messenger of God." Habib could
			not survive this torture and these inhuman atrocities much longer
			and he soon passed away. On his pure lips, as his life-blood
			ebbed away, was the name of the blessed Prophet to whom he had
			pledged loyalty on the night of Aqabah, the name of Muhammad, the
			Messenger of God.
		</p>
		<p>
			News of Habib's fate reached his mother and her reaction was
			simply to say: "It was for such a situation that I prepared
			him... He pledged allegiance to the Prophet on the night of
			Aqabah as a small child and today as an adult he has given his
			life for the Prophet. If God were to allow me to get near to
			Musaylamah, I would certainly make his daughters smite their
			cheeks and lament over him."
		</p>
		<p>
			The day that she wished for was not long in coming. After the
			death of the Prophet, peace be on him, Abu Bakr declared war on
			the imposter. With the Muslim army that went out to confront the
			forces of Musaylamah were Habib's mother, Nusaybah, and another
			of her courageous sons, Abdullah ibn Zayd.
		</p>
		<p>
			At the Battle of Yamamah which ensued, Nusaybah was seen cutting
			through the ranks of fighting men like a lioness and calling out:
			"Where is the enemy of God? Show me the enemy of God ?" When she
			eventually reached Musaylamah, he had already perished. She
			looked at the body of the vain imposter and cruel tyrant and felt
			serene. A grave threat to the Muslims had been removed and the
			death of her beloved son, Habib, had been avenged.
		</p>
		<p>
			At Habib's death, the noble Prophet had commended him and his
			entire family and had prayed: "May God bless this household. May
			God have mercy on this household."
		</p>

	<biography name="Rabiah ibn Kab">
		<p>
			Here is the story of Rabiah told in his own words: "I was still
			quite young when the light of iman shone through me and my heart
			was opened to the teachings of Islam. And when my eyes beheld the
			Messenger of God, for the first time, I loved him with a love
			that possessed my entire being. I loved him to the exclusion of
			everyone else.
		</p>
		<p>
			One day I said to myself:
		</p>
		<p>
			'Woe to you, Rabi'ah. Why don't you put yourself completely in
			the service of the Messenger of God, peace be on him. Go and
			suggest this to him. If he is pleased with you, you would find
			happiness in being near him. You will be successful through love
			for him and you will have the good fortune of obtaining the good
			in this world and the good in the next.'
		</p>
		<p>
			This I did hoping that he would accept me in his service. He did
			not dash my hopes. He was pleased that I should be his servant.
			From that day, I lived in the shadow of the noble Prophet. I went
			with him wherever he went. I moved in his orbit whenever and
			wherever he turned. Whenever he cast a glance in my direction, I
			would leap to stand in his presence. Whenever he expressed a
			need, he would find me hurrying to fulfil it.
		</p>
		<p>
			I would serve him throughout the day. When the day was over and
			he had prayed Salat al-Isha and retired to his home, I would
			think about leaving. But I would soon say to myself:
		</p>
		<p>
			'Where would you go, Rabi'ah? Perhaps you may be required to do
			something for the Prophet during the night.' So I would remain
			seated at his door and would not leave the threshold of his
			house. The Prophet would spend part of his night engaged in
			Salat. I would hear him reciting the opening chapter of the Quran
			and he would continue reciting sometimes for a third or a half of
			the night. I would become tired and leave or my eyes would get
			the better of me and I would fail asleep.
		</p>
		<p>
			It was the habit of the Prophet, peace be on him, that if someone
			did him a good turn, he loved to repay that person with something
			more excellent. He wanted to do something for me too in return
			for my service to him. So one day he came up tome and said: 'O
			Rabi'ah ibn Kab.' 'Labbayk ya rasulullah wa Sadark - At your
			command, O Messenger of God and may God grant you happiness,' I
			responded. 'Ask of me anything and I will give it to you.'
		</p>
		<p>
			I thought a little and then said: 'Give me some time, O Messenger
			of God, to think about what I should ask of
		</p>
		<p>
			you. Then I will let you know.' He agreed.
		</p>
		<p>
			At that time, I was a young man and poor. I had neither family,
			nor wealth, nor place of abode. I used to shelter in the Suffah
			of the mosque with other poor Muslims like myself. People used to
			call us the "guests of Islam". Whenever any Muslim brought
			something in charity to the Prophet, he would send it all to us.
			And if someone gave him a gift he would take some of it and leave
			the rest for us.
		</p>
		<p>
			So, it occurred to me to ask the Prophet for some worldly good
			that would save me from poverty and make me like others who had
			wealth, wife and children. Soon, however, I said: 'May you perish
			Rabi'ah. The world is temporary and will pass away. You have your
			share of sustenance in it which God has guaranteed and which must
			come to you. The Prophet, peace be on him, has a place with his
			Lord and no request would be refused him. Request him therefore,
			to ask Allah to grant you something of the bounty of the
			hereafter.'
		</p>
		<p>
			I felt pleased and satisfied with this thought. I went to the
			Prophet and he asked: 'What do you say, O Rabi'ah?' 'O Messenger
			of God,' I said, 'I ask you to beseech God most High on my behalf
			to make me your companion in Paradise.'
		</p>
		<p>
			'Who has advised you thus?' asked the Prophet.
		</p>
		<p>
			'No by God,' I said, 'No one has advise me. But when you told me
			'Ask of me anything and I will give to you,' I thought of asking
			you for something of the goodness of this world. But before long,
			I was guided to choose what is permanent and lasting against what
			is temporary and perishable. And so I have asked you to beseech
			God on my behalf that I may be your companion in Paradise.'
		</p>
		<p>
			The Prophet remained silent for a long while and then asked: 'Any
			other request besides that, Rabi'ah?' 'No, O Messenger of God,
			Nothing can match what I have asked you.' 'Then, in that case,
			assist me for your sake by performing much prostration to God.'
		</p>
		<p>
			So I began to exert myself in worship in order to attain the good
			fortune of being with the Prophet in Paradise just as I had the
			good fortune of being in his service and being his companion in
			this world.
		</p>
		<p>
			Not long afterwards, the Prophet called me and asked: 'Don't you
			want to get married, Rabi'ah?' 'I do not want anything to
			distract me from your service,' I replied. 'Moreover, I don't
			have anything to give as mahr (dowry) to a wife nor any place
			where I can accommodate a wife.'
		</p>
		<p>
			The Prophet remained silent. When he saw me again he asked:
			'Don't you want to get married, Rabi'ah?' I gave him the same
			reply as before. Left to myself again, I regretted what I had
			said and chided myself: 'Woe to you, Rabi'ah. By God, the Prophet
			knows better than you what is good for you in this world and the
			next and he also knows better than you what you possess. By God,
			if the Prophet, peace be on him, should ask me again to marry, I
			would reply positively.'
		</p>
		<p>
			Before long, the Prophet asked me again: 'Don't you want to get
			married 'Rabi'ah?'
		</p>
		<p>
			'Oh yes, Messenger of God,' I replied, 'but who will marry me
			when I am in the state you know.' 'Go to the family of so-and-so
			and say to them: the Prophet has instructed you to give your
			daughter in marriage to me.'
		</p>
		<p>
			Timidly, I went to the family and said: 'The Messenger of God,
			peace be on him, has sent me to you to ask you to give your
			daughter in marriage to me.' 'Our daughter?' they asked,
			incredulously at first. 'Yes,' i replied.
		</p>
		<p>
			'Welcome to the Messenger of God, and welcome to his messenger.
			By God, the messenger of God's Messenger shall only return with
			his mission fulfilled. 'So they made a marriage contract between
			me and her. I went back to the Prophet and reported:
		</p>
		<p>
			'O Messenger of Allah. I have come from the best of homes. They
			believed me, they welcomed me, and they made a marriage contract
			between me and their daughter. But from where do I get the mahr
			for her?'
		</p>
		<p>
			The Prophet then sent for Buraydah ibn al-Khasib, one of the
			leading persons in my tribe, the Banu Asiam, and said to him: 'O
			Buraydah, collect a nuwat's weight in gold for Rabi'ah.
		</p>
		<p>
			This they did and the Prophet said to me: 'Take this to them and
			say, this is the sadaq of your daughter.' I did so and they
			accepted it. They were pleased and said, This is much and good.'
			I went back to the Prophet and told him: 'I have never yet seen a
			people more generous than they. They were pleased with what I
			gave them in spite of its being little...Where can I get
			something for the walimah (marriage feast), O Prophet of God?'
		</p>
		<p>
			The Prophet said to Buraydah 'Collect the price of a ram for
			Rabi'ah.' They bought a big fat ram for me and then the Prophet
			told me: 'Go to Aishah and tell her to give you whatever barley
			she has.'
		</p>
		<p>
			Aishah gave me a bag with seven saas of barley and said: 'By God,
			we do not have any other food.' I set off with the ram and the
			barley to my wife's family. They said: 'We will prepare the
			barley but get your friends to prepare the ram for you.'
		</p>
		<p>
			We slaughtered, skinned and cooked the ram. So we had bread and
			meat for the walimah. I invited the Prophet and he accepted my
			invitation.
		</p>
		<p>
			The Prophet then gave me a piece of land near Abu Bakr's. From
			then I became concerned with the dunya, with material things. I
			had a dispute with Abu Bakr over a palm tree.
		</p>
		<p>
			'It is in my land,' I insisted. 'No, it is in my land,' Abu Bakr
			countered. We started to argue. Abu Bakr cursed me, but as soon
			as he had uttered the offending word. he felt sorry and said to
			me: 'Rabiah, say the same word to me so that it could be
			considered as qisas -just retaliation.' 'No by God, I shall not,'
			I said.
		</p>
		<p>
			'In that case, replied Abu Bakr. 'I shall go the Messenger of God
			and complain to him about your refusal to retaliate against me
			measure for measure.'
		</p>
		<p>
			He set off and I followed him. My tribe, the Banu Asiam, also set
			off behind me protesting indignantly: 'He's the one who cursed
			you first and then he goes off to the Prophet before you to
			complain about you!' I turned to them and said: 'Woe to you! Do
			you know who this is? This is As-Siddiq... and he is the
			respected elder of the Muslims. Go back before he turns around,
			sees you and thinks that you have come to help me against him. He
			would then be more incensed and go to the Prophet in anger. The
			Prophet would get angry on his account. Then Allah would be angry
			on their account and Rabi'ah would be finished.' They turned
			back.
		</p>
		<p>
			Abu Bakr went to the Prophet and related the incident as it had
			happened. The Prophet raised his head and said to me:
		</p>
		<p>
			'O Rabi'ah, what's wrong with you and as-Siddiq?' 'Messenger of
			God, he wanted me to say the same words to him as he had said to
			me and I did not.'
		</p>
		<p>
			'Yes, don't say the same word to him as he had said to you.
			Instead say: 'May God forgive you Abu Bakr.' With tears in his
			eyes, Abu Bakr went away while saying: 'May God reward you with
			goodness for my sake, O Rabiah ibn Kab... 'May God reward you
			with goodness for my sake, O Rabiah ibn Kaab..."

			all the characteristics of pride, manliness and generosity. He
			took great pride in the traditions of his ancestors.
		</p>
		<p>
			Abu-l Aas inherited the Quraysh love for trade. The Quraysh of
			course were known to be masters of the two annual trading
			expeditions. the winter expedition to the south, to Yemen. and
			the summer expedition to the north. to Syria. These two
			expeditions are mentioned in the Quran in the chapter named after
			the Quraysh.
		</p>
		<p>
			The caravans of Abu-l Ads always plied between Makkah and Syria.
			Each caravan was made up of two hundred men and a hundred camels.
			People would entrust their wealth and their goods to him to trade
			on their behalf because of his skill as a merchant. his honesty
			and his trustworthiness.
		</p>
		<p>
			The maternal aunt of Abu-l Aas was Khadijah bint Khuwaylid, the
			wife of Muhammad ibn Abdullah. She treated him like a mother
			would her own son, with love and affection. Muhammad too was
			extremely fond of him.
		</p>
		<p>
			The years went by quickly in the household of Muhammad and
			Khadijah. Zanaib, their eldest daughter, soon grew up and
			blossomed forth like a lovely flower. She was much sought after
			in marriage by the sons of respectable Makkan nobles. And why
			not? She was one of the most distinguished Makkan girls in
			lineage and social standing. She was blessed with the most
			honorable father and mother. And she had the finest morals and
			behavior.
		</p>
		<p>
			Which one of these scions of Makkan nobility would win her hand?
			Abu-l Aas ibn Rabi'ah was the one who did.
		</p>
		<p>
			Abu-l Aas and Zaynab were only married a few years when the
			Divine light of Islam radiated over Makkah. Muhammad, the father
			of Zaynab, was now the Prophet of God, sent to convey the
			religion of guidance and truth. He was commanded to convey the
			message of Islam first to his family and nearest relatives. The
			first women to believe in him and accept Islam were his wife
			Khadijah and his daughters Zaynab, Ruqayyah, Umm Kulthum and
			Fatimah. Fatimah was very young at the time.
		</p>
		<p>
			Zaynab's husband however did not like leaving the religion of his
			forefathers and he refused to adopt the religion which his wife
			now followed although he was completely devoted to her and loved
			her dearly with a pure and sincere love.
		</p>
		<p>
			Before long, the confrontation between the Prophet, peace be upon
			him, and the Quraysh developed and grew bitter. The Quraysh felt
			that it was intolerable for their sons to remain married to
			Muhammad's daughters. They also considered that it would be an
			embarrassing and difficult situation for Muhammad if his
			daughters were to be returned to his household. So they went to
			Abu-l Aas and said:
		</p>
		<p>
			"Divorce your wife, Abu-l Aas, and send her back to her father's
			house. We shall then marry you to any of the most charming and
			noble women of the Quraysh you desire."
		</p>
		<p>
			"No, by God," said Abu-l Aas firmly. "I shall not divorce my wife
			and I do not wish to have in her place any woman in all the
			world."
		</p>
		<p>
			Muhammad's other two daughters, Ruqayyah and Umm Kulthum were
			divorced by their husbands and returned to his home. The Prophet
			in fact was delighted when they came back to him and he had hoped
			that Abu-l Aas would also return Zaynab to him except that at
			that time he had no power to compel him to do so. The law
			forbidding the marriage of a Muslim woman to a nonbelieving man
			was not yet in force.
		</p>
		<p>
			The Prophet, peace be on him, migrated to Madinah and his mission
			became stronger. The Quraysh felt even more threatened by him
			,red went out to confront him at Badr. Abu-l Aas was compelled to
			go along with the Quraysh army. He did not really have d desire
			to fight the Muslims nor did he feel any inclination to join
			them. But his position among the Quraysh- one of honor and trust
			- impelled him to go along with their campaign against Muhammad.
			The battle of Badr ended in d terrible defeat for the Quraysh and
			the forces of shirk. Some were killed, some were taken prisoner
			and some managed to escape. Among those, who were taken prisoner
			was Abu-l Aas, the husband of Zaynab.
		</p>
		<p>
			The Prophet fixed amounts for the ransom of the prisoners of war
			varying from one thousand to four thousand dirhams, according to
			the wealth and social standing of the prisoner. Quraysh
			messengers went to and fro between Makkah and Madinah bearing the
			ransom money to free their relatives held in Madinah. Zaynab sent
			her messenger to Madinah bearing the ransom demand to free her
			husband. The ransom amount included a necklace which her mother,
			Khadijah, had given to her before she died. When the Prophet saw
			the necklace, his face at once became covered with a veil of
			sadness and he felt a surge of tenderness for his daughter. He
			turned to his companions and said:
		</p>
		<p>
			"Zaynab has sent this amount to ransom Abu-l Aas. If you see fit
			to set free her prisoner and return her possession to her, then
			do so."
		</p>
		<p>
			"Yes," his companions agreed. "We shall do whatever we can to
			soothe your eyes and make you happy."
		</p>
		<p>
			The Prophet set one condition on Abu-l Aas before he freed him,
			that he should send his daughter Zaynab to him without delay.
		</p>
		<p>
			As soon as he reached Makkah, Abu-l Aas began making arrangements
			to carry out his promise. He ordered his wife to prepare herself
			for the journey and told her that her father's messengers were
			waiting for her just outside Makkah. He prepared provisions and a
			mount for her and instructed his brother, Amr ibn ar-Rabi'ah, to
			accompany her and hand her over personally to the Prophet's
			emissaries.
		</p>
		<p>
			Amr slung his bow over his shoulders, took up his quiver of
			arrows, placed Zaynab in her hawdaj and left Makkah with her in
			the broad light of day, in full view of the Quraysh.
		</p>
		<p>
			The Quraysh were furious. They pursued Zaynab and Amr until they
			caught up with them. Zaynab was scared. Amr stood poised with his
			bow and arrow and shouted:
		</p>
		<p>
			"By God, if any man come near to her, I would plunge this arrow
			in his neck". Amr was known to be an excellent marksman.
		</p>
		<p>
			Abu Sufyan ibn Hath, who had by this time joined the Quraysh
			group, went up to Amr and said: "Son of my brother, put away your
			arrow and let me talk to you."
		</p>
		<p>
			This Amr did and Abu Sufyan went on: "What you have done is not
			prudent. You left with Zaynab in full view of the people. All the
			Arabs know the disasters we suffered at Badr at the hands of her
			father, Muhammad. If you leave with his daughter in the open as
			you have done, the tribes would accuse us of cowardice and they
			would say that we have been humiliated. Return with her and ask
			her to stay in her husband's house for a few days so that people
			could say that we brought her back. Thereafter you can take her
			away quietly and secretly from us and take her to her father. We
			have no need to detain her."
		</p>
		<p>
			Amr agreed to this and Zaynab returned to Makkah. A few days
			later, in the middle of the night Amr took Zaynab and handed her
			over to the Prophet's emissaries just as his brother had
			instructed.
		</p>
		<p>
			After the departure of his wife, Abu-l Aas stayed on in Makkah
			for several years. Then, shortly before the conquest of Makkah,
			he left for Syria on a trading mission. On the return journey
			from Syria his caravan consisted of some one hundred camels and
			one hundred and seventy men.
		</p>
		<p>
			As the caravan approached Madinah, a detachment of Muslims took
			them by surprise. They impounded the camels and took the men as
			captives to the Prophet. Abu-l Aas however managed to escape.
			During the night which was pitch black, Abu-l Aas entered Madinah
			fearful and alert. He searched around until he came to Zaynab's
			house. He asked her for protection and she gave it to him.
		</p>
		<p>
			At dawn, the Prophet, peace be on him, came out to the masjid to
			perform the Dawn Prayer. He stood erect in the mihrab and said
			"Allahu Akbar" to begin the Prayer. The Muslims behind him did
			the same. At that point Zaynab shouted from the women's section
			of the masjid:
		</p>
		<p>
			"O people! I am Zaynab the daughter of Muhammad. I have given
			protection to Abu-l Aas. Do give him your protection also."
		</p>
		<p>
			When the Prayer was finished, the Prophet turned to the
			congregation and said: "Have you heard what I heard?" "Yes,
			Messenger of Allah," they replied.
		</p>
		<p>
			"By Him in Whose hand is my soul, I knew nothing of this until I
			heard what you heard. He is asking protection from the Muslims."
		</p>
		<p>
			Back at home the Prophet said to his daughter: "Prepare a place
			of rest for Abu-l Aas and let him know that you are not lawful
			for him." He then summoned the men of the expeditionary force
			which had taken the camels and the men of the caravan and said to
			them:
		</p>
		<p>
			"You have taken the possessions of this man. If you are kind to
			him and return his property, we would be pleased. If however you
			do not agree then the goods is booty sanctioned by God which you
			have a right to."
		</p>
		<p>
			"We would certainly return his possessions to him, Messenger of
			God," they replied and when Abu-l Aas came to collect his goods,
			they said to him:
		</p>
		<p>
			"You belong to the Quraysh nobility. You are the nephew of the
			Messenger of God and his son-in-law. Would you accept Islam? We
			would hand over all this wealth to you. You would then have for
			your own enjoyment whatever wealth and possessions the Makkans
			entrusted to you, and stay with us here in Madinah."
		</p>
		<p>
			"What an evil thing you are asking me do, to enter a new religion
			while committing an act of treachery!" Abu-I Aas retorted.
		</p>
		<p>
			Abu-l Aas returned to Makkah with the caravan and handed over all
			the wealth and goods to their rightful owners. Then he asked:
		</p>
		<p>
			"O people of Quraysh! Is there any money left with me belonging
			to any one of you which he has not taken?"
		</p>
		<p>
			"No," came the reply. "And may God bless you with goodness. We
			have indeed found you noble and trustworthy."
		</p>
		<p>
			Then Abu-I Aas announced: "Since I have now handed over to you
			what is rightfully yours, I now declare that there is no god but
			Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah. By God, the
			only thing that prevented me from declaring my acceptance of
			Islam while I was with Muhammad in Madinah was my fear that you
			would think that I did so only to appropriate your wealth. Now
			that I have discharged my trust in this matter, I now declare
			that I am a Muslim..."
		</p>
		<p>
			Abu-l Aas then left for Madinah where the Prophet received him
			hospitably and returned his wife to him. The Prophet used to say
			about him: "He spoke to me and was truthful to me. He made
			promises to me and remained faithful to his word."

	<biography name="Rumaysa bint Milhan">
		<p>
			Even  before  Islam  was  introduced  to Yathrib, Rumaysa was
			known for her excellent character, the power of her intellect and
			her independent attitude of mind. She was known by various names
			including Rumaysa and Ghumaysa, but these were possibly
			nicknames. One historian says that her real name was Sahlah but
			later she was popularly known as Umm Sulaym.
		</p>
		<p>
			Umm Sulaym was first married to Malik ibn an-Nadr and her son by
			this marriage was the famous Anas ibn Malik, one of the great
			companions of the Prophet.
		</p>
		<p>
			Umm Sulaym was one of the first women of Yathrib to accept Islam.
			She was influenced by the refined, dedicated and persuasive Musab
			ibn Umayr who was sent out as the first missionary or ambassador
			of Islam by the noble Prophet. This was after the first pledge of
			Aqabah. Twelve men of Yathrib had gone to Aqabah on the outskirts
			of Makkah to pledge loyalty to the Prophet. This was the first
			major break through for the mission of the Prophet for many
			years.
		</p>
		<p>
			Umm Sulaym's decision to accept Islam was made without the
			knowledge or consent of her husband, Malik ibn an-Nadr. He was
			absent from Yathrib at the time and when he returned he felt some
			change had come over his household and asked his wife: "Have you
			been rejuvenated?" "No," she said, "but I (now) believe in this
			man (meaning the Prophet Muhammad)."
		</p>
		<p>
			Malik was not pleased especially when his wife went on to
			announce her acceptance of Islam in public and instruct her son
			Anas in the teachings and practice of the new faith. She taught
			him to say la ilaha ilia Allah and Ash hadu anna Muhammada-r
			Rasulullah. The young Anas repeated this simple but profound
			declaration of faith clearly and emphatically.
		</p>
		<p>
			Umm Sulaym's husband was now furious. He shouted at her: "Don't
			corrupt my son." "I am not corrupting him ," she replied firmly.
		</p>
		<p>
			Her husband then left the house and it is reported that he was
			set upon by an enemy of his and was killed. The news shocked but
			apparently did not upset Umm Sulaym greatly. She remained devoted
			to her son Anas and was concerned about his. proper upbringing.
			She is even reported to have said that she would not marry again
			unless Anas approved.
		</p>
		<p>
			When it was known that Umm Sulaym had become a widow, one man,
			Zayd ibn Sahl, known as Abu Talhah, resolved to become engaged to
			her before anyone else did.
		</p>
		<p>
			He was rather confident that Umm Sulaym would not pass him over
			for another. He was after all a strong and virile person who was
			quite rich and who possessed an imposing house that was much
			admired. He was an accomplished horseman and a skilful archer
			and, moreover, he belonged to the same clan as Umm Sulaym, the
			Banu Najjar.
		</p>
		<p>
			Abu Talhah proceeded to Umm Sulaym's house. On the way he
			recalled that she had been influenced by the preaching of Musab
			ibn Umayr and had become a Muslim.
		</p>
		<p>
			"So what?" he said to himself. "Was not her husband who died a
			firm adherent of the old religion and was he not opposed to
			Muhammad and his mission?"
		</p>
		<p>
			Abu Talhah reached Umm Sulaym's house. He asked and was given
			permission to enter. Her son Anas was present. Abu Talhah
			explained why he had come and asked for her hand in marriage.
		</p>
		<p>
			"A man like you, Abu Talhah ," she said, "is not (easily) turned
			away. But I shall never marry you while you are a kafir, an
			unbeliever."
		</p>
		<p>
			Abu Talhah thought she was trying to put him off and that perhaps
			she had already preferred someone wealthier and more influential.
			He said to her:
		</p>
		<p>
			"What is it that really prevents you from accepting me, Umm
			Sulaym? Is it the yellow and the white metals (gold and silver)?"
		</p>
		<p>
			"Gold and silver?" she asked somewhat taken aback and in a
			slightly censuring tone. "Yes," he said. "I swear to you, Abu
			Talhah, and I swear to God and His Messenger that if you accept
			Islam, I shall be pleased to accept you as a husband, without any
			gold or silver. I shall consider your acceptance of Islam as my
			mahr."
		</p>
		<p>
			Abu Talhah understood well the implications of her words. His
			mind turned to the idol he had made from wood and on which he
			lavished great attention in the same way that important men of
			his tribe venerated and cared for their personal idols.
		</p>
		<p>
			The opportunity was right for Umm Sulaym to stress the futility
			of such idol worship and she went on: "Don't you know Abu Talhah,
			that the god you worship besides Allah grew from the earth?"
			"That's true," he said.
		</p>
		<p>
			"Don't you feel stupid while worshipping part of a tree while you
			use the rest of it for fuel to bake bread or warm yourself? (If
			you should give up these foolish beliefs and practices) and
			become a Muslim, Abu Talhah, I shall be pleased to accept you as
			a husband and I would not want from you any sadaqah apart from
			your acceptance of Islam."
		</p>
		<p>
			"Who shall instruct me in Islam?" asked Abu Talhah. "I shall,"
			Umm Sulaym replied. "How?"
		</p>
		<p>
			"Utter the declaration of truth and testify that there is no god
			but Allah and that Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah. Then go to
			your house, destroy your idol and throw it away."
		</p>
		<p>
			Abu Talhah left and reflected deeply on what Umm Sulaym had said.
			He came back to her beaming with happiness.
		</p>
		<p>
			"I have taken your advice to heart. I declare that there is no
			god but Allah and I declare that Muhammad is the Messenger of
			Allah."
		</p>
		<p>
			Umm Sulaym and Abu Talhah were married. Anas, her son, was
			pleased and the Muslims would say: "We have never yet heard of a
			mahr that was more valuable and precious than that of Umm Sulaym
			for she made Islam her mahr."
		</p>
		<p>
			Umm Sulaym was pleased and delighted with her new husband who
			placed his unique energies and talents in the service of Islam.
			He was one of the seventy three men who swore allegiance to the
			Prophet at the second Pledge of Aqabah. With him, according to
			one report, was his wife Umm Sulaym. Two other women, the
			celebrated Nusaybah bint Kab and Asma bint Amr witnessed Aqabah
			and took the oath of allegiance to the Prophet.
		</p>
		<p>
			Abu Talhah was devoted to the Prophet and took enormous delight
			in simply looking at him and listening to the sweetness of his
			speech. He participated in all the major military campaigns. He
			lived a very ascetic life and was known to fast for long periods
			at a time. It is said that he had a fantastic orchard in Madinah
			with date palms and grapes and running water. One day while he
			was performing Salat in the shade of the trees, a beautiful bird
			with brightly colored plumage flew in front of him. He became
			engrossed in the scene and forgot how many rakats he had prayed.
			Two? Three? When he completed the Prayer he went to the Prophet
			and described how he had been distracted. In the end, he said:
			"Bear witness, Messenger of Allah, that I hand over this orchard
			as a charity for the sake of Allah, the Exalted."
		</p>
		<p>
			Abu Talhah and Umm Sulaym had an exemplary Muslim family life,
			devoted to the Prophet and the service of Muslims and Islam. The
			Prophet used to visit their home. Sometimes when the time of
			Prayer came, he would pray on a mat provided by Umm Sulaym.
			Sometimes also he would have a siesta in their house and, as he
			slept, she would wipe the perspiration from his forehead. Once
			when the Prophet awoke from his siesta, he asked: "Umm Sulaym,
			what are you doing?" "I am taking these (drops of perspiration)
			as a barakah (blessing) which comes from you ," she replied.
		</p>
		<p>
			At another time, the Prophet went to their house and Umm Sulaym
			offered him dates and butterfat but he did not have any of it
			because he was fasting. Occasionally, she would send her son Anas
			with bags of dates to his house.
		</p>
		<p>
			It was noticed that the Prophet, peace be on him, had a special
			compassion for Umm Sulaym and her family and when asked about it,
			he replied: "Her brother was killed beside me."
		</p>
		<p>
			Umm Sulaym also had a well-known sister, Umm Haram, the wife of
			the imposing Ubadah ibn as-Samit. She died at sea during a naval
			expedition and was buried in Cyprus. Umm Sulaym's husband, Abu
			Talhah, also died while he was on a naval expedition during the
			time of the third Caliph, Uthman, and was buried at sea.
		</p>
		<p>
			Umm Sulaym herself was noted for her great courage and bravery.
			During the Battle of Uhud, she carried a dagger in the folds of
			her dress. She gave water to and tended the wounded and she made
			attempts to defend the Prophet when the tide of battle was
			turning against him. At the Battle of Khandaq, the Prophet saw
			her carrying a dagger and he asked her what she was doing with
			it. She said: "It is to fight those who desert."
		</p>
		<p>
			"May God grant you satisfaction in that," replied the Prophet. In
			the face of adversity, Umm Sulaym displayed a unique calmness and
			strength. One of her young sons (Umayr) fell sick and died while
			her husband was away looking after his orchards. She bathed the
			child and wrapped him in shrouds. She told others at her home
			that they should not inform Abu Talhah because she herself wanted
			to tell him.
		</p>
		<p>
			Umm Sulaym had another son whose name was Abdullah. A few days
			after she gave birth, she sent Anas with the baby and a bag of
			dates to the Prophet. The Prophet placed the baby on his lap. He
			crushed the dates in his mouth and put some in the baby's mouth.
			The baby sucked the dates with relish and the Prophet said: "The
			Ansar are only fond of dates."
		</p>
		<p>
			Abdullah eventually grew up and had seven children all of whom
			memorized the Quran.
		</p>
		<p>
			Umm Sulaym was a model Muslim, a model wife and mother. Her
			belief in God was strong and uncompromising. She was not prepared
			to endanger her faith and the upbringing of her children for
			wealth and luxury, however abundant and tempting.
		</p>
		<p>
			She was devoted to the Prophet and dedicated her son Anas to his
			service. She took the responsibility of educating her children
			and she played an active part in public life, sharing with the
			other Muslims the hardships and the joys of building a community
			and living for the pleasure of God.

	<biography name="Talhah ibn Ubaydullah">
		<p>
			Returning to Makkah in haste after a trading trip to Syria,
			Talhah asked his family: "Did anything happen in Makkah since we
			left?" "Yes," they replied.  "Muhammad ibn Abdullah emerged
			alleging that he is a Prophet and Abu Quhafah (Abu Bakr) has
			followed him."
		</p>
		<p>
			"I used to know Abu Bakr," said Talhah. "He is an easy-going,
			amiable, gentle man. He was an honest and upright trader. We were
			quite fond of him and loved sitting in his company because of his
			knowledge of Quraysh history and genealogy."
		</p>
		<p>
			Later, Talhah went to Abu Bakr and asked: "Is it true what they
			say, that Muhammad ibn Abdullah has appeared as a Prophet and
			that you follow him." "Yes," replied Abu Bakr and went on to tell
			Talhah about Muhammad and what a good thing it would be if he too
			followed him. Talhah in turn told Abu Bakr the story of his
			strange recent encounter with an ascetic in the market-place of
			Busra in Syria. The ascetic is said to have told Talhah that
			someone called "Ahmad" would appear in Makkah about that time and
			that he would be the last of the Prophets. He also told Talhah,
			so the story goes, that the Prophet would leave the sacred
			precincts of Makkah and migrate to a land of black soil, water
			and palm trees...
		</p>
		<p>
			Abu Bakr was astonished by the story and took Talhah to Muhammad.
			The Prophet, peace be on him, explained Islam to Talhah and
			recited some portions of the Quran to him. Talhah was
			enthusiastic. He related to the Prophet his conversation with the
			ascetic of Busra. There and then, Talhah pronounced the Shahadah
			- that there is no god but Allah and that Muhammad is the
			Messenger of Allah. He was the fourth person who had been
			introduced to Islam by Abu Bakr.
		</p>
		<p>
			The Quraysh were astounded by the young Talhah's acceptance of
			Islam. The one who was most dismayed and unhappy was his mother.
			She had hoped that he would one day be a leader in his community
			because of his noble character and his outstanding virtues. Some
			of the Quraysh, anxious and worried, went to Talhah as soon as
			they could to wean him away from his new religion but found him
			firm and unshakable as a rock. When they despaired of using
			gentle persuasion to achieve their aim, they resorted to
			persecution and violence. The following story is related by Masud
			ibn Kharash:
		</p>
		<p>
			"While I was making saiy between as-Safa and al-Marwa, there
			appeared a crowd of people pushing a young man whose hands were
			tied behind his back. As they rushed behind him, they rained down
			blows on his head. In the crowd was an old woman who lashed him
			repeatedly and shouted abuses at him. I asked: 'What's the matter
			with this young man?' 'This is Talhah ibn Ubaydullah. He gave up
			his religion and now follows the Banu Hashim man.' 'And who is
			the woman behind him?' I asked. 'She is as-Sabah bint al-Hadrami,
			the young man's mother,' they said.
		</p>
		<p>
			The  Quraysh  did  not	stop there.  Nawfal  ibn Khuwaylid,
			nicknamed the 'lion of the Quraysh" bound Talhah with a rope and
			with the same rope he tied up Abu Bakr and then handed them over
			to the mindless and violent mob of Makkah to be beaten and
			tortured. The shared experience no doubt drew Talhah and Abu Bakr
			closer together!
		</p>
		<p>
			Years passed and events of great significance took place. Talhah
			grew in stature as he bore the pain and suffering of being tested
			in the path of God and His Prophet. He gained the unique
			reputation among Muslims of being called the "living martyr". The
			Prophet, peace be on him, also called him "Talhah the Good" and
			"Talhah the Generous".
		</p>
		<p>
			The name of the "living martyr" was earned during the Battle of
			Uhud. Talhah had missed the Battle of Badr. He and Said ibn Zayd
			had been sent outside Madinah on a mission by the Prophet and
			when they returned, the Prophet and his companions were already
			on the way back from Badr. They were both sad at having missed
			the opportunity of taking part in the first campaign with the
			Prophet but were tremendously pleased when he told them they
			would get the same reward as those who actually fought.
		</p>
		<p>
			At the Battle of Uhud, when the Muslims fell into disarray at the
			beginning of hostilities the Prophet became dangerously exposed.
			There were about eleven men of the Ansar at his side and one
			Muhajir - Talhah ibn Ubaydullah. The Prophet clambered up the
			mountain hotly pursued by some mushrikin. The Prophet, peace be
			on him, shouted:
		</p>
		<p>
			"The one who repulses these people from us will be my companion
			in Paradise." "I, O Messenger of god," shouted Talhah.
		</p>
		<p>
			"No, stick to your position," replied the Prophet. A man from the
			Ansar volunteered and the Prophet agreed. He fought until he was
			killed. The Prophet went further up the mountain with the
			mushrikin still in close pursuit. "Isn't there someone to combat
			these?"
		</p>
		<p>
			Talhah again volunteered but the Prophet ordered him to maintain
			his position. Another person immediately came forward, fought and
			was killed. This happened until all who stood by the Prophet were
			martyred except Talhah.
		</p>
		<p>
			"Now, yes," signalled the Prophet and Talhah went into battle. By
			this time, the Prophet's teeth had been broken, his forehead had
			been slashed, his lips had been wounded and blood was streaming
			down his face. He was drained of energy. Talhah plunged into the
			enemy and pushed them away from the Prophet. He turned back to
			the Prophet and helped him a little further up the mountain and
			put him to lie on the ground. He then renewed his attack and
			successfully repulsed the enemy. About this occasion Abu Bakr
			said:
		</p>
		<p>
			"At that moment, Abu Ubayd ibn al-Jarrah and I were far from the
			Prophet. When we came close to him to render assistance to him,
			the Prophet said: 'Leave me and go to your companion (meaning
			Talhah)."
		</p>
		<p>
			There was Talhah, bleeding profusely. He had numerous wounds,
			from sword, spear and arrow. His foot had been cut and he had
			fallen into a hollow where he lay unconscious.
		</p>
		<p>
			Thereafter, the Prophet, peace be on him, said: "Whoever is
			pleased to see a man still walking on earth who had completed his
			span (of life), let him look at Talhah ibn Ubaydallah."
		</p>
		<p>
			And, whenever Uhud was recalled, As-Siddiq, may God be pleased
			with him, would say: "That day, that entire day, belonged to
			Talhah."
		</p>
		<p>
			That was the story of how Talhah became to be called the "living
			martyr". There were unnumerabIe incidents which led to him being
			called "Talhah the Good" and "Talhah the Generous".
		</p>
		<p>
			Talhah was an astute and successful merchant who travelled widely
			to the north and south of the Arabian peninsula. It is said that
			after one of his trips to Hadramawt, he had profits amounting to
			some seven hundred thousand dirhams. His nights would be anxious
			and worried on account of this vast wealth. On one such night,
			his wife, Umm Kulthum the daughter of Abu Bakr, said to him:
		</p>
		<p>
			"What's wrong with you, O father of Muhammad? Perhaps I have done
			something to hurt you.'?" "No ," replied Talhah. "You are a
			wonderful wife for a Muslim man. But I have been thinking since
			last night: How can a man think of his Lord and Sustainer when he
			goes to sleep with this wealth in his house?"
		</p>
		<p>
			"Why should it bother you so much ," remarked Umm Kulthum. "What
			about all the needy ones in your community and all your friends?
			When you get up in the morning share it out among them."
		</p>
		<p>
			"God bless you. You are really marvellous, the daughter of a
			marvellous man," said Talhah to his wife. In the morning, Talhah
			gathered up the money in bags and distributed it among the poor
			Muhajirin and Ansar.
		</p>
		<p>
			It is related that a man came up to Talhah requesting help and
			also mentioning some common family connection between them.
		</p>
		<p>
			"This family connection someone has mentioned to me before," said
			Talhah who was in fact known for his generosity to all members of
			his clan. Talhah told the man that he had just sold a piece of
			land to Uthman ibn Allan for several thousand dirhams. The man
			could have the money or the land which could be re-purchased from
			Uthman. The man opted for the money and Talhah gave it all to
			him.
		</p>
		<p>
			Talhah was well-known for helping persons who had debt problems,
			heads of families who experienced hardship, and widows. One of
			his friends, as-Saib ibn Zayd, said of him: "I accompanied Talhah
			ibn Ubaydallah on journeys and I stayed with him at home and I
			have not found anyone who was more generous with money, with
			clothes and with food than Talhah."
		</p>
		<p>
			No wonder he was called "Talhah the Good" and "Talhah the
			Generous".
		</p>
		<p>
			The name Talhah is also connected with the first fitnah or civil
			war among Muslims after the death of the prophet, peace be on
			him.
		</p>
		<p>
			The seeds of trouble were sown during the caliphate of Uthman ibn
			Affan. There were many complaints and accusations against him.
			Some mischief-makers were not content with accusations only but
			were determined to finish him off. In the year 35 AH (656 CE) a
			group of insurgents stormed Uthman's house and murdered him while
			he was reading the Quran. It was one of the most shocking events
			in the early history of Islam.
		</p>
		<p>
			Ali was persuaded to accept the responsibility of the Caliphate
			and all Muslims swore allegiance to him, including Talhah and
			Zubayr ibn al-Awwam. Talhah and Zubayr were deeply shocked by the
			murder of Uthman. They were horrified and felt strongly that the
			murderers should be punished and that justice should be done. But
			the punishment of the murderers was not an easy task in as much
			as the crime was not just the work of a few individuals but
			involved a large number of persons.
		</p>
		<p>
			Talhah and Zubayr sought Ali's permission to go to Makkah to
			perform Umrah. They met Aishah the wife of the Prophet. She was
			greatly shocked when she heard of the assassination of Uthman.
			From Makkah, Talhah, Zubayr and Aishah set off for Basrah where
			large numbers were gathering to seek revenge for the death of
			Uthman.
		</p>
		<p>
			The forces gathered at Basrah seemed to present an open challenge
			to Ali. As the caliph of the Muslims and the head of the entire
			Muslim State, he could not tolerate any insurrection or armed
			revolt against the State. But what a difficult and awesome task
			he faced! To deal with the revolt, he had to confront his
			brothers, his companions and his friends-followers of the Prophet
			and his religion, those who often fought side by side with him
			against the forces of shirk, those whom he respected and loved.
		</p>
		<p>
			The forces clamoring for vengeance for Uthman and those
			supporting Ali met at a place called Kuraybah, near Basrah. Ali
			desired to avoid war and settle matters by peaceful means. He
			used every means at his disposal to achieve peace. He clung to
			every hope of avoiding confrontation. But the dark forces at work
			against Islam and how numerous were these, were determined that
			matters should come to a terrible and bloody end.
		</p>
		<p>
			Ali wept. He wept bitterly when he saw Aishah, the "Mother of the
			Believers" in her hawdaj or palanquin astride a camel at the head
			of the army which now emerged to fight him. And when he saw
			Talhah and Zubayr, two close companions of the Prophet, in the
			midst of the army, he shouted to them to come out to him. They
			did and Ali said to Talhah:
		</p>
		<p>
			"O Talhah, have you come with the wife of the Messenger of Allah
			to fight along with her...?" And to Zubayr he said:
		</p>
		<p>
			"O Zubayr, I implore you, by God, do you remember the day when
			the Prophet. peace be on him, passed by you and we were in such
			and such a place and he asked you: 'Do you love Ali?' and you
			said: 'Why shouldn't I love my cousin and one who follows my
			religion...?'"
		</p>
		<p>
			Ali continued talking to them reminding them of the bonds of
			brotherhood and faith. In the end both Talhah and Zubayr withdrew
			from participation in this civil war. They withdrew immediately
			when they saw the situation in a different light. But they paid
			for that withdrawal with their lives.
		</p>
		<p>
			As they withdrew, a man named Amr ibn Jarmouz followed Zubayr and
			cowardly murdered him while he performed Salat. Talhah was killed
			by an arrow allegedly shot by Marwan - a cousin of Uthman who was
			too blinded by rage and the desire to seek revenge for his
			kinsman to respond to the possibility of avoiding war and
			bloodshed among Muslims.
		</p>
		<p>
			The murder of Uthman had become Talhah's tryst with destiny. He
			did not participate in the fighting and killing that followed
			that came to be known in history as the "Battle of the Camel".
			Indeed, if he had known that the fitnah would have degenerated
			into such insane hatred and bitterness and resulted in such a
			bloody outcome, he would have resisted it. He was not keen to
			fight Ali. He was simply appalled by the murder of Uthman and
			wanted to see justice done. Before the beginning of the battle he
			had said in a voice choked with emotion:
		</p>
		<p>
			"O Lord, for the sake of Uthman, take from me this day until You
			are pleased." Then when Ali faced him and Zubayr, they saw the
			correctness of his position and withdrew from the field of
			battle. Yet, in these difficult circumstances, martyrdom was
			reserved for them.
		</p>
		<p>
			The Battle of Camel came to an end. Aishah, the mother of the
			believers, realized that she had precipitated matters and left
			Basrah for the Sacred Mosque and then to Madinah distancing
			herself from the conflict. Ali provided well for her journey
			giving her all the comfort and honor due to her.
		</p>
		<p>
			When the numerous dead from the battle were brought together, Ali
			led the funeral prayer for them all, those who were with him and
			those who were against him. And when he had finished burying
			Talhah and Zubayr he bade farewell to them with a heavy heart, a
			heart filled with tenderness and love.
		</p>
		<p>
			"I really hope," he said in simple and sublime words, "that
			Talhah, az-Zubayr, Uthman and I will be among those of whom God
			has said: 'And We shall remove from their hearts any lurking
			sense of injury and rancor; they will be brothers joyfully facing
			each other on thrones of dignity.' "(The Quran, Surah al-Hijr,
			15:47)
		</p>
		<p>
			Then he looked tenderly and sorrowfully on the graves of his
			brothers in faith and said: "I have heard with these two ears of
			mine the Messenger of Allah, may Allah bless him and grant him
			peace, saying: "Talhah and az-Zubayr are my companions in
			Paradise!"

		<p>
			After a long and exhausting journey, the Prophet, peace be on
			him, is at last on the outskirts of Yathrib. The good people of
			the city go out to meet him. Many crowd the narrow streets. Some
			stand on roof-tops chanting La ilaha ilia Allah and Allahu Akbar
			in sheer joy at meeting the Prophet of Mercy and his loyal
			companion, Abu Bakr as-Siddiq. The small girls of the city come
			out gaily beating their daffs and singing the words of welcome:
		</p>
		<p>
			Tala 'a-l badru alaynaa
		</p>
		<p>
			Min Thaniyaati-l Wadaa' Wajaba-sh shukru alaynaa
		</p>
		<p>
			Maa da'aa lillaahi daa' Ayyuha-l mab 'uthu finaa
		</p>
		<p>
			Ji'ta bi-l amri-l mutaa' Ji'ta sharrafta-l Madinah
		</p>
		<p>
			Marhaban yaa khayra-d daa'.
		</p>
		<p>
			"The full moon has come upon us. From beyond the hills of
			Thaniyaati-l Wadaa Grateful we must be. For what to God he calls?
			O you who has been sent among us? You came with a mission to be
			obeyed. You came, you honoured the city; Welcome, O best of those
			who call (to God).
		</p>
		<p>
			As the procession of the blessed Prophet wended its way, all
			around there were joyful hearts, tears of ecstasy, smiles of
			sheer happiness.
		</p>
		<p>
			Far away from these scenes of jubilation and delight was a young
			man named Uqbah ibn Aamir al-Juhani. He had gone out to the
			bawadi, the open expanses of desert, to graze his flocks of sheep
			and goats on the sparse vegetation. He had wandered far in search
			of fodder for his hungry flock. It was difficult to find suitable
			grazing grounds and he was constantly afraid that his flock would
			perish. They were all he possessed and he did not want to lose
			them.
		</p>
		<p>
			The happiness which engulfed Yathrib, henceforth to be known as
			the radiant city of the Prophet, soon spread to the near and
			distant bawadi and reached every nook and corner of the land. The
			good news of the Prophet's arrival finally reached Uqbah as he
			tended his flocks far away in the inhospitable desert. His
			response to the news was immediate as he himself relates: "The
			Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace, came to Madinah
			while I was tending my sheep. When I heard the news of his
			coming, I set out to meet him without delay. When I met him I
			asked:
		</p>
		<p>
			'Will you accept my pledge of allegiance, O Messenger of God?'
			'And who are you?' asked the Prophet. 'Uqbah ibn Aamir al-Juhani
			,' I replied. 'Which do you prefer,' he asked, 'the pledge of a
			nomad or the pledge of someone who has migrated?' 'The pledge of
			someone who has migrated,' I said. So the Messenger of God took
			the same pledge from me as he did from the Muhajirin. I spent the
			night with him and then went back to my flock.
		</p>
		<p>
			There were twelve of us who had accepted Islam but we lived far
			from the city tending our sheep and goats in the open country. We
			came to the conclusion that it would be good for us if we went to
			the Prophet daily, so that he could instruct us in our religion
			and recite for us whatever revelation he had received from on
			high. I told the others:
		</p>
		<p>
			'Take turns to go to the Messenger of God, peace be on him.
			Anyone going may leave his sheep with me because I am too worried
			and concerned about my own flock to leave them in the care of
			someone else.'
		</p>
		<p>
			Each day, one after another of my friends went to the Prophet,
			leaving his sheep for me to look after. When each returned, I
			learnt from him what he had heard and benefitted from what he had
			understood. Before long, however, I returned to my senses and
			said to myself:
		</p>
		<p>
			'Woe to you! Is it because of a flock of sheep that you remain
			thin and wretched and lose the opportunity to be in the company
			of the Prophet and to speak directly to him without an
			intermediary':' With this, I left my flock, went to Madinah and
			stayed in the masjid close to the Messenger of God, may God bless
			him and grant him peace."
		</p>
		<p>
			Uqbah had no reason to regret having taken this fateful decision.
			Within a decade, he had become one of the outstanding scholars
			among the companions of the Prophet, a competent and beautiful
			reciter of the Quran, a military commander and later on one of
			the eminent Muslim governors as Islam spread east and west with
			astonishing rapidity. He could never have imagined as he left his
			flock to follow the teachings of the noble Prophet, that he would
			have been among the vanguard of the Muslim forces that liberated
			fertile Damascus - then known as the "mother of the universe" and
			that he would have a house for himself among its verdant gardens.
			He could never have imagined that he would be one of the
			commanders who liberated Egypt, then known as the "emerald of the
			world", and that he would be one of its governors.
		</p>
		<p>
			The fateful decision however was taken. Alone, without
			possessions. or relatives, Uqbah came to Madinah from the hawadi.
			He stayed with others like him on the Suffah or elevated part of
			the Prophet's mosque, near his house. The Suffah was like a
			reception point where people like Uqbah would go because they
			wanted to be close to the Prophet. They were known as the "Ashab
			as-Suffah" and the Prophet once described them as the "guests of
			Islam".
		</p>
		<p>
			Because they had no income, the Prophet always shared his food
			with them and encouraged others to be generous to these "guests".
			They spent much of their time studying the Quran and learning
			about Islam. What a marvellous opportunity they had! They were in
			close and regular contact with the Prophet. He had a special love
			and concern for them and took care to educate them and look after
			them in all respects. Uqbah gave an example of how the Prophet
			trained and taught them. He said:
		</p>
		<p>
			"One day, the Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace,
			came out to us while we were on the Suffah and asked:
		</p>
		<p>
			'Which of you would like to go out to the open country or a
			valley every day and fetch for himself two beautiful, black
			camels?' (Such camels were considered prize possessions. )
		</p>
		<p>
			'Everyone of us would like that, O Messenger of God,' we all
			replied.
		</p>
		<p>
			'Now,' he said, 'each one of you should go to the mosque and
			learn two ayats (verses) of the Book of God. This is better for
			him than two camels; three verses are better than three camels;
			four verses are better than four camels (and son)."
		</p>
		<p>
			In this way, the Prophet tried to bring about a change in
			attitudes among those who had accepted Islam, a change from
			obsession with acquiring worldly possessions to an attitude of
			devotion to knowledge. His simple example provided them with
			motivation and a powerful incentive to acquire knowledge.
		</p>
		<p>
			On other occasions, the Ashab as-Suffah would ask questions of
			the Prophet in order to understand their religion better. Once,
			Uqbah said, he asked the Prophet, "What is salvation?" and he
			replied: "Control your tongue, make your house spacious for
			guests and spurn your mistakes."
		</p>
		<p>
			Even outside the mosque, Uqbah tried to stay close to the
			Prophet. On journeys, he often took the reins of the Prophet's
			mule and went wherever the Prophet desired. Sometimes he followed
			directly behind the Prophet, peace be on him, and so came to be
			called the redif of the Prophet. On some occasions, the Prophet
			would descend from his mount and allow Uqbah to ride while he
			himself walked. Uqbah described one such occasion:
		</p>
		<p>
			"I took hold of the reins of the Prophet's mule while passing
			through some palm groves of Madinah.
		</p>
		<p>
			'Uqbah ,' the Prophet said to me, 'don't you want to ride.'?'
		</p>
		<p>
			I thought of saying 'no' but I felt there might be an element of
			disobedience to the Prophet in such a reply so I said: 'Yes, O
			Prophet of God.'
		</p>
		<p>
			The Prophet then got down from his mule and I mounted in
			obedience to his command. He began to walk. Shortly afterwards I
			dismounted. The Prophet mounted again and said to me:
		</p>
		<p>
			'Uqbah, shall I not teach you two surahs the like of which has
			not been heard before.'?'
		</p>
		<p>
			'Certainly, O Messenger of God,' I replied. And so he recited to
			me "Qul a'udhu bi rabbi-l Falaq" and "Qul a'udhu bi rabbi-n nas"
			(the last two surahs of the Quran). I then said the Iqamah for
			Salat. The Prophet led the Salat and recited these two surahs.
			(Afterwards), he said: 'Read both these surahs when you go to
			sleep and whenever you wake up.'"
		</p>
		<p>
			The above instances show  "continuous education" at its best, at
			home, in the mosque, riding, walking in the open school of the
			Prophet, may Allah bless him and grant him peace.
		</p>
		<p>
			Two objectives occupied Uqbah's attention throughout his life;
			the search for knowledge and jihad in the path of God. He applied
			his energies totally to these objectives.
		</p>
		<p>
			In the field of learning, he drank deeply from the fountain of
			knowledge that was the Messenger of God, peace be on him. Uqbah
			became a distinguished muqri (reciter of the Quran), a muhaddith
			(recorder and narrator of the sayings of the Prophet); a faqih
			(jurist); a faradi (expert on the Islamic laws of inheritance);
			an adib (literateur); a fasih (orator) and a sha'ir (poet).
		</p>
		<p>
			In reciting the Quran, he had a most pleasant and beautiful
			voice. In the stillness of the night, when the entire universe
			seems peaceful and tranquil, he would turn to the Book of God,
			and recite its overpowering verses. The hearts of the noble
			companions would be drawn to his recitation. Their whole being
			would be shaken and they would be moved to tears from the fear of
			God which his recitation induced.
		</p>
		<p>
			One day Umar ibn al-Khattab invited him and said:
		</p>
		<p>
			"Recite for me something from the Book of God, O Uqbah." "At your
			command, O Amir al-Muminin," said Uqbah and began reciting. Umar
			wept till his beard was wet.
		</p>
		<p>
			Uqbah left a copy of the Quran written in his own hand. It is
			said that this copy of the Quran existed until quite recently in
			Egypt in the well-known mosque named after Uqbah ibn Aamir
			himself. At the end of this text was written: "Uqbah ibn Aamir
			al-Juhani wrote it." This Mushaf of Uqbah was one of the earliest
			copies of the Quran in existence but it was lost in its entirety
			with other priceless documents due to the carelessness of
			Muslims.
		</p>
		<p>
			In the field of Jihad, it is sufficient to know that Uqbah fought
			beside the Prophet, peace be on him, at the Battle of Uhud and in
			all the military engagements thereafter. He was also one of the
			valiant and daring group of shock troopers who were tested to
			their maximum during the battle for Damascus. In recognition for
			his outstanding services, the commander of the Muslim forces
			then, Abu Ubaydah ibn al-Jarrah, despatched Uqbah to Madinah to
			convey the good news of the liberation of Damascus to Umar ibn
			al-Khattab. Uqbah spent eight days and seven nights, from Friday
			to Friday, in a continuous forced march to bring the news to
			Umar.
		</p>
		<p>
			Uqbah was one of the commanders of the Muslim forces that
			liberated Egypt. For three years he was the Muslim governor of
			Egypt after which he received orders from the Caliph Muawiyah to
			mount a naval expedition to the island of Rhodes in the
			Mediterranean Sea.
		</p>
		<p>
			An indication of Uqbah's enthusiasm for jihad is the fact that he
			committed to memory the sayings of the Prophet on this subject
			and became a specialist in narrating them to the Muslims. One of
			his favorite pastimes was to practice the skill of spear
			throwing.
		</p>
		<p>
			Uqbah was in Egypt when he became fatally ill. He gathered his
			children together and gave them his final advise. He said: "My
			children, guard against three things: Don't accept; my saying
			attributed to the Prophet, peace be on him, except from a
			reliable authority. Do not incur debts or take up a loan even if
			you are in the position of an imam. Don't compose poetry for your
			hearts might be distracted thereby from the Quran."
		</p>
		<p>
			Uqbah ibn Aamir al-Juhani, the qari, the alim, the ghazi, died in
			Cairo and was buried at the foot of the Muqattam hills.

	<biography name="Musab ibn Umayr">
		<p>
			Musab ibn Umayr was born and grew up in the lap of affluence and
			luxury. His rich parents lavished a great deal of care and
			attention on him. He wore the most expensive clothes and the most
			stylish shoes of his time. Yemeni shoes were then considered to
			be very elegant and it was his privilege to have the very best of
			these.
		</p>
		<p>
			As a youth he was admired by the Quraysh not only for his good
			looks and style but for his intelligence. His elegant bearing and
			keen mind endeared him to the Makkan nobility among whom he moved
			with ease. Although still young, he had the privilege of
			attending Quraysh meetings and gatherings.  He was thus in a
			position to know the issues which concerned the Makkans and what
			their attitudes and strategies were.
		</p>
		<p>
			Among Makkans there was a sudden outburst of excitement and
			concern as Muhammad, known as al-Amin (the Trustworthy), emerged
			saying that God had sent him as a bearer of good tidings and as a
			warner. He warned the Quraysh of terrible chastisement if they
			did not turn to the worship and obedience of God and he spoke of
			Divine rewards for the righteous. The whole of Makkah buzzed with
			talk of these claims. The vulnerable Quraysh leaders thought of
			ways of silencing Muhammad.  When ridicule and persuasion did not
			work, they embarked on a campaign of harassment and persecution.
		</p>
		<p>
			Musab learnt that Muhammad and those who believed in his message
			were gathering in a house near the hill of as-Safa to evade
			Quraysh harassment. This was the house of al-Arqam.  To satisfy
			his curiosity, Musab proceeded to the house undererred by the
			knowledge of Quraysh hostility. There he met the Prophet teaching
			his small band of companions, reciting the verses of the Quran to
			them and performing Salat with them in submission to God, the
			Great, the Most High.
		</p>
		<p>
			The Prophet welcomed him, and with his noble hand tenderly
			touched Musab's heart as it throbbed with excitement.  A deep
			feeling of tranquility came over
		</p>
		<p>
			him.
		</p>
		<p>
			Musab was totally overwhelmed by what he had seen and heard. The
			words of the Quran had made a deep and immediate impression on
			him.
		</p>
		<p>
			In this first meeting with the Prophet, the young and decisive
			Musab declared his acceptance of Islam. It was a historic moment.
			The keen mind of Musab, his tenacious will and determination, his
			eloquence and his beautiful character were now in the service of
			Islam and would help change the course of men's destinies and of
			history.
		</p>
		<p>
			On accepting Islam Musab had one major concern his mother.  Her
			name was Khunnas bint Malik.  She was a woman of extraordinary
			power. She had a dominant personality and could easily arouse
			fear and terror. When Musab became a Muslim, the only power on
			earth he might have feared was his mother. All the powerful
			nobles of Makkah and their attachment to pagan customs and
			traditions were of little consequence to him. Having his mother
			as an opponent, however, could not be taken lightly.
		</p>
		<p>
			Musab thought quickly. He decided that he should conceal his
			acceptance of Islam until such time as a solution should come
			from God. He continued to frequent the House of al-Arqam and sit
			in the company of the Prophet. He felt serene in his new faith
			and by keeping all indications of his acceptance of Islam away
			from her, he managed to stave off his mother's wrath, but not for
			long.
		</p>
		<p>
			It was difficult during those days to keep anything secret in
			Makkah for long.  The eyes and ears of the Quraysh were on every
			road. Behind every footstep imprinted in the soft and burning
			sand was a Quraysh informer. Before long, Musab was seen as he
			quietly entered the House of al-Arqam, by someone called Uthman
			ibn Talhah.
		</p>
		<p>
			At another time, Uthman saw Musab praying in the same manner as
			Muhammad prayed.  The conclusion was obvious.
		</p>
		<p>
			As winds in a storm, the devastating news of Musab's acceptance
			of Islam spread among the Quraysh and eventually reached his
			mother.
		</p>
		<p>
			Musab stood before his mother, his clan and the Quraysh nobility
			who had all gathered to find out what he had done and what he had
			to say for himself.
		</p>
		<p>
			With a certain humility and calm confidence, Musab acknowledged
			that he had become a Muslim and no doubt he explained his reasons
			for so doing. He then recited some verses of the Quran - verses
			which had cleansed the hearts of the believers and brought them
			back to the natural religion of God. Though only few in number,
			their hearts were now filled with wisdom, honor, justice and
			courage.
		</p>
		<p>
			As Musab's mother listened to her son on whom she had lavished so
			much care and affection, she became increasingly incensed. She
			felt like silencing him with one terrible blow.  But the hand
			which shot out like an arrow staggered and faltered before the
			light which radiated from Musab's serene face. Perhaps, it was
			her mother's love which restrained her from actually beating him,
			but still she felt she had to do something to avenge the gods
			which her son had forsaken. The solution she decided upon was far
			worse for Musab than a few blows could ever have been.	She had
			Musab taken to a far corner of the house.  There he was firmly
			bound and tethered.  He had become a prisoner in his own home.
		</p>
		<p>
			For a long time, Musab remained tied and confined under the
			watchful eyes of guards whom his mother had placed over him to
			prevent him from any further contact with Muhammad and his faith.
			Despite his ordeal, Musab did not waver. He must have had news of
			how other Muslims were being harassed and tortured by the
			idolators.  For him, as for many other Muslims, life in Makkah
			was becoming more and more intolerable. Eventually he heard that
			a group of Muslims were preparing secretly to migrate to
			Abyssinia to seek refuge and relief. His immediate thoughts were
			how to escape from his prison and join them. At the first
			opportunity, when his mother and his warders were off-guard, he
			managed to slip away quietly. Then with utmost haste he joined
			the other refugees and before long they sailed together across
			the Red Sea to Africa.
		</p>
		<p>
			Although the Muslims enjoyed peace and security in the land of
			the Negus, they longed to be in Makkah in the company of the
			noble Prophet. So when a report reached Abyssinia that the
			conditions of the Muslims in Makkah had improved, Musab was among
			the first to return to Makkah.	The report was in fact false and
			Musab once again left for Abyssinia.
		</p>
		<p>
			Whether he was in Makkah or Abyssinia, Musab remained strong in
			his new faith and his main concern was to make his life worthy of
			his Creator.
		</p>
		<p>
			When Musab returned to Makkah again, his mother made a last
			attempt to gain control of him and threatened to have him tied up
			again and confined. Musab swore that if she were to do that, he
			would kill everyone who helped her.  She knew very well that he
			would carry out this threat for she saw the iron determination he
			now had.
		</p>
		<p>
			Separation was inevitable. When the moment came, it was sad for
			both mother and son but it revealed a strong Persistence in kufr
			on the part of the mother and an even greater persistence in iman
			on the part of the son. As she threw him out of her house and cut
			him off from all the material comforts she used to lavish on him,
			she said:
		</p>
		<p>
			"Go to your own business. I am not prepared to be a mother to
			you." Musab went up close to her and said:
		</p>
		<p>
			"Mother, I advise you sincerely.  I am concerned about you.  Do
			testify that there is no god but Allah and that Muhammad is His
			servant and His Messenger."
		</p>
		<p>
			"I swear by the shooting stars, I shall not enter your religion
			even if my opinion is ridiculed and my mind becomes impotent,"
			she insisted.
		</p>
		<p>
			Musab thus left her home and the luxury and comforts he used to
			enjoy. The elegant, well-dressed youth would henceforth be seen
			only in the coursest of attire. He now had more important
			concerns.  He was determined to use his talents and energies in
			acquiring knowledge and in serving God and His Prophet.
		</p>
		<p>
			One day, several years later, Musab came upon a gathering of
			Muslims sitting around the Prophet, may God bless him and grant
			him peace. They bowed their heads and lowered their gaze when
			they saw Musab, and some were even moved to tears. This was
			because his jalbab was old and in tatters and they were
			immediately taken back to the days before his acceptance of Islam
			when he was a model of sartorial elegance. The Prophet looked at
			Musab, smiled gracefully and said:
		</p>
		<p>
			"I have seen this Musab with his parents in Makkah. They lavished
			care and attention on him and gave him all comforts.  There was
			no Quraysh youth like him. Then he left all that seeking the
			pleasure of God and devoting himself to the service of His
			Prophet." The Prophet then went on to say:
		</p>
		<p>
			"There will come a time when God will grant you victory over
			Persia and Byzantium.  You would have one dress in the morning
			and another in the evening and you would eat out of one dish in
			the morning and another in the evening."
		</p>
		<p>
			In other words, the Prophet predicted that the Muslims would
			become rich and powerful and that they would have material goods
			in plenty. The companions sitting around asked the Prophet:
		</p>
		<p>
			"O Messenger of Allah, are we in a better situation
		</p>
		<p>
			in these times or would we be better off then?" He replied:
		</p>
		<p>
			"You are rather better off now than you would be then. If you
			knew of the world what I know you would certainly not be so much
			concerned with it."
		</p>
		<p>
			On another occasion, the Prophet talked in a similar vein to his
			companions and asked them how they would be if they could have
			one suit of clothes in the morning and another in the evening and
			even have enough material to put curtains in their houses just as
			the Kabah was fully covered. The companions replied that they
			would  then be in a better situation because they would then have
			sufficient sustenance and would be free for ibadah (worship). The
			Prophet however told them that they were indeed better off as
			they were.
		</p>
		<p>
			After about ten years of inviting people to Islam, most of Makkah
			still remained hostile. The noble Prophet then went to Taif
			seeking new adherents to the faith. He was repulsed and chased
			out of the city. The future of Islam looked bleak.
		</p>
		<p>
			It was just after this that the Prophet chose Musab to be his
			"ambassador" to Yathrib to teach a small group of believers who
			had come to pledge allegiance to Islam and prepare Madinah for
			the day of the great Hijrah.
		</p>
		<p>
			Musab was chosen above companions who were older than he or were
			more closely related to the Prophet or who appeared to possess
			greater prestige.  No doubt Musab was chosen for this task
			because of his noble character, his fine manners and his sharp
			intellect. His knowledge of the Quran and his ability to recite
			it beautifully and movingly was also an important consideration.
		</p>
		<p>
			Musab understood his mission well.  He knew that he was on a
			sacred mission. to invite people to God and the straight path of
			Islam and to prepare what was to be the territorial base for the
			young and struggling Muslim community.
		</p>
		<p>
			He entered Madinah as a guest of Sad ibn Zurarah of the Khazraj
			tribe.	Together they went to people, to their homes and their
			gatherings, telling them about the Prophet, explaining Islam to
			them and reciting the Quran.  Through the grace of God, many
			accepted Islam.  This was especially pleasing to Musab but
			profoundly alarming to many leaders of Yathribite society.
		</p>
		<p>
			Once Musab and Sad were sitting near a well in an orchard of the
			Zafar clan. With them were a number of new Muslims and others who
			were interested in Islam. A powerful notable of the city, Usayd
			ibn Khudayr, came up brandishing a spear.  He was livid with
			rage. Sad ibn Zararah saw him and told Musab:
		</p>
		<p>
			"This is a chieftain of his people.  May God place truth in his
			heart." "If he sits down, I will speak to him," replied Musab,
			displaying all the calm and tact of a great daiy.
		</p>
		<p>
			The angry Usayd shouted abuse and threatened Musab and his host.
			"Why have you both come to us to corrupt the weak among us?  Keep
			away from us if you want to stay alive." Musab smiled a warm and
			friendly smile and said to Usayd: "Won't you sit down and listen?
			If you are pleased and satisfied with our mission. accept it and
			if you dislike it we would stop telling you what you dislike and
			leave."
		</p>
		<p>
			"That's reasonable," said Usayd and, sticking his spear in the
			ground, sat down. Musab was not compelling him to do anything. He
			was not denouncing him. He was merely inviting him to listen. If
			he was satisfied, well and good. If not, then Musab would leave
			his district and his clan without any fuss and go to another
			district.
		</p>
		<p>
			Musab began telling him about Islam and recited the Quran to him.
			 Even before Usayd spoke, it was clear from his face, now radiant
			and expectant, that faith had entered his heart. He said:
		</p>
		<p>
			"How beautiful are these words and how true! What does a person
			do if he wants to enter this religion?"
		</p>
		<p>
			"Have a bath, purify yourself and your clothes. Then utter the
			testimony of Truth (Shahadah), and perform Salat. Usayd left the
			gathering and was absent for only a short while. He returned and
			testified that there is no god but Allah and that Muhammad is the
			Messenger of Allah. He then prayed two rakats and said:
		</p>
		<p>
			"After me, there is a man who if he follows you, everyone of his
			people will follow him. I shall send him to you now. He is 'Sad
			ibn Muadh."
		</p>
		<p>
			Sad ibn Muadh came and listened to Musab.  He was convinced and
			satisfied and declared his submission to God.  He was followed by
			another important Yathribite, Sad ibn Ubadah.  Before long, the
			people of Yathrib were all in a flurry, asking one another.
		</p>
		<p>
			"If Usayd ibn Khudayr, Sad ibn Muadh and Sad ibn Ubadah have
			accepted the new religion, how can we not follow?  Let's go to
			Musab and believe with him.  They say that truth emanates from
			his lips."
		</p>
		<p>
			The first ambassador of the Prophet, peace be on him, was thus
			supremely successful. The Prophet had chosen well. Men and women,
			the young and the old, the powerful and the weak accepted Islam
			at his hands. The course of Yathribite history had been changed
			forever. The way was being prepared for the great Hijrah. Yathrib
			was soon to become the center and the base for the Islamic state.
		</p>
		<p>
			Less than a year after his arrival in Yathrib, Musab returned to
			Makkah. It was again in the season of pilgrimage. With him was a
			group of seventy-five Muslims from Madinah.  Again at Aqabah,
			near Mina, they met the Prophet. There they solemnly undertook to
			defend the Prophet at all cost. Should they remain firm in their
			faith, their reward, said the Prophet, would be nothing less than
			Paradise. This second bayah or pledge which the Muslims of
			Yathrib made came to be called the Pledge of War.
		</p>
		<p>
			From then on events moved swiftly.  Shortly after the Pledge, the
			Prophet directed his persecuted followers to migrate to Yathrib
			where the new Muslims or Ansar (Helpers) had shown their
			willingness to give asylum and extend their protection to the
			afflicted Muslims. The first of the Prophet's companions to
			arrive in Madinah were Musab ibn Umayr and the blind Abdullah ibn
			Umm Maktum.  Abdullah also recited the Quran beautifully and
			according to one of the Ansar, both Musab and Abdullah recited
			the Quran for the people of Yathrib.
		</p>
		<p>
			Musab continued to play a major role in the building of the new
			community. The next momentous situation in which we meet him was
			during the great Battle of Badr. After the battle was over, the
			Quraysh prisoners of war were brought to the Prophet who assigned
			them
		</p>
		<p>
			to the custody of individual Muslims. "Treat them well," he
			instructed.
		</p>
		<p>
			Among the prisoners was Abu Aziz ibn Umayr, the brother of Musab.
			 Abu Aziz related what happened: "I was among a group of
			Ansar...Whenever they had lunch or dinner they would give me
			bread and dates to eat in obedience to the Prophet's instructions
			to them to treat us well.
		</p>
		<p>
			"My brother, Musab ibn Umayr, passed by me and said to the man
			from the Ansar who was holding me prisoner:
		</p>
		<p>
			'Tie him  firmly... His mother is a woman of great wealth and
			maybe she would ransom him for you.'" Abu Aziz could not believe
			his ears. Astonished, he turned to Musab and asked: "My brother,
			is this your instruction concerning me?" "He is my brother, not
			you," replied Musab thus affirming that in the battle between
			iman and kufr, the bonds of faith were stronger than the ties of
			kinship.
		</p>
		<p>
			At the Battle of Uhud, the Prophet called upon Musab, now
			well-known as Musab al-Khayr (the Good), to carry the Muslim
			standard. At the beginning of the battle, the Muslims seemed to
			be gaining the upper hand.  A group of Muslims then went against
			the orders of the Prophet and deserted their positions. The
			mushrikin forces rallied again and launched a counterattack. 
			Their main objective, as they cut through the Muslim forces, was
			to get to the noble Prophet.
		</p>
		<p>
			Musab realized the great danger facing the Prophet. He raised the
			standard high and shouted the takbir. With the standard in one
			hand and his sword in the other, he plunged into the Quraysh
			forces.  The odds were against him. A Quraysh horseman moved in
			close and severed his right hand. Musab was heard to repeat the
			words:
		</p>
		<p>
			"Muhammad is only a Messenger.	Messengers have passed away
			before him," showing that however great his attachment was to the
			Prophet himself, his struggle above all was for the sake of God
			and for making His word supreme. His left hand was then severed
			also and as he held the standard between the stumps of his arms,
			to console himself he repeated:  "Muhammad is only a Messenger of
			God. Messengers have passed away before him." Musab was then hit
			by a spear. He fell and the standard fell. The words he repeated,
			every time he was struck were later revealed to the Prophet and
			completed, and became part of the Quran.
		</p>
		<p>
			After the battle, the Prophet and his companions went through the
			battlefield, bidding farewell to the martyrs. When they came to
			Musab's body, tears flowed. Khabbah related that they could not
			find any cloth with which to shroud Musab's body, except his own
			garment.  When they covered his head with it, his legs showed and
			when his legs were covered, his head was exposed and the Prophet
			instructed:
		</p>
		<p>
			"Place the garment over his head and cover his feet and legs with
			the leaves of the idhkhir (rue) plant."
		</p>
		<p>
			The Prophet felt deep pain and sorrow at the number of his
			companions who were killed at the Battle of Uhud.  These included
			his uncle Hamzah whose body was horribly mutilated.  But it was
			over the body of Musab that the Prophet stood, with great
			emotion. He remembered Musab as he first saw him in Makkah,
			stylish and elegant, and then looked at the short burdah which
			was now the only garment he possessed and he recited the verse of
			the Quran:
		</p>
		<p>
			"Among the believers are men who have been true to what they have
			pledged to God."
		</p>
		<p>
			The Prophet then cast his tender eyes over the battle field on
			which lay the dead companions of Musab and said: "The Messenger
			of God testifies that you are martyrs in the sight of God on the
			day of Qiyamah."
		</p>
		<p>
			Then turning to the living companions around him he said: "O
			People!  Visit them, send peace on them for, by Him in whose hand
			is my soul, any Muslim who sends peace on them until the day of
			Qiyamah, they would return the salutation of peace."
		</p>
		<p>
			As-salaamu alayka yaa Musab...
		</p>
		<p>
			As-salaamu alaykum,  ma'shar ash-shudhadaa.
		</p>
		<p>
			As-salaamu alaykum wa rahmatullah wa barakatuhu.
		</p>
		<p>
			Peace be on you, O Musab...
		</p>
		<p>
			Peace be on you all, O martyrs.  .
		</p>
		<p>
			Peace be on you and the mercy and blessings of God.

	<biography name="Fatimah bint Muhammad">
		<p>
			Fatimah was the fifth child of Muhammad and Khadijah. She was
			born at a time when her noble father had begun to spend long
			periods in the solitude of mountains around Makkah, meditating
			and reflecting on the great mysteries of creation.
		</p>
		<p>
			This was the time, before the Bithah, when her eldest sister
			Zaynab was married to her cousin, al-Aas ibn ar Rabiah. Then
			followed the marriage of her two other sisters, Ruqayyah and Umm
			Kulthum, to the sons of Abu Lahab, a paternal uncle of the
			Prophet. Both Abu Lahab and his wife Umm Jamil turned out to be
			flaming enemies of the Prophet from the very beginning of his
			public mission.
		</p>
		<p>
			The little Fatimah thus saw her sisters leave home one after the
			other to live with their husbands. She was too young to
			understand the meaning of marriage and the reasons why her
			sisters had to leave home. She loved them dearly and was sad and
			lonely when they left. It is said that a certain silence and
			painful sadness came over her then.
		</p>
		<p>
			Of course, even after the marriage of her sisters, she was not
			alone in the house of her parents. Barakah, the maid-servant of
			Aminah, the Prophet's mother, who had been with the Prophet since
			his birth, Zayd ibn Harithah, and Ali, the young son of Abu Talib
			were all part of Muhammad's household at this time.  And of
			course there was her loving mother, the lady Khadijah.
		</p>
		<p>
			In her mother and in Barakah, Fatimah found a great deal of
			solace and comfort. in Ali, who was about two years older than
			she, she found a "brother" and a friend who somehow took the
			place of her own brother al-Qasim who had died in his infancy.
			Her other brother Abdullah, known as the Good and the Pure, who
			was born after her, also died in his infancy.  However in none of
			the people in her father's household did Fatimah find the
			carefree joy and happiness which she enjoyed with her sisters. 
			She was an unusually sensitive child for her age.
		</p>
		<p>
			When she was five, she heard that her father had become Rasul
			Allah, the Messenger of God. His first task was to convey the
			good news of Islam to his family and close relations.  They were
			to worship God Almighty alone.	Her mother, who was a tower of
			strength and support, explained to Fatimah what her father had to
			do. From this time on, she became more closely attached to him
			and felt a deep and abiding love for him. Often she would be at
			Iris side walking through the narrow streets and alleys of
			Makkah, visiting the Kabah or attending secret gatherings off,
			the early Muslims who had accepted Islam and pledged allegiance
			to the Prophet.
		</p>
		<p>
			One day, when she was not yet ten, she accompanied her father to
			the Masjid al-Haram. He stood in the place known as al-Hijr
			facing the Kabah and began to pray. Fatimah stood at his side. A
			group of Quraysh, by no means well-disposed to the Prophet,
			gathered about him. They included Abu Jahl ibn Hisham, the
			Prophet's uncle, Uqbah ibn Abi Muayt, Umayyah ibn Khalaf, and
			Shaybah and Utbah, sons of Rabi'ah. Menacingly, the group went up
			to the Prophet and Abu Jahl, the ringleader, asked:
		</p>
		<p>
			"Which of you can bring the entrails of a slaughtered animal and
			throw it on Muhammad?"
		</p>
		<p>
			Uqbah ibn Abi Muayt, one of the vilest of the lot, volunteered
			and hurried off.  He returned with the obnoxious filth and threw
			it on the shoulders of the Prophet, may God bless him and grant
			him peace, while he was still prostrating.  Abdullah ibn Masud, a
			companion of the Prophet, was present but he was powerless to do
			or say anything.
		</p>
		<p>
			Imagine the feelings of Fatimah as she saw her father being
			treated in this fashion. What could she, a girl not ten years
			old, do? She went up to her father and removed the offensive
			matter and then stood firmly and angrily before the group of
			Quraysh thugs and lashed out against them.  Not a single word did
			they say to her. The noble Prophet raised his head on completion
			of the prostration and went on to complete the	Salat.	He then
			said: "O Lord, may you punish the Quraysh!" and repeated this
			imprecation three times.  Then he continued:
		</p>
		<p>
			"May You punish Utbah, Uqbah, Abu Jahl and Shaybah."  (These whom
			he named were all killed many years later at the Battle of Badr)
		</p>
		<p>
			On another occasion, Fatimah was with the Prophet as he made;
			tawaf around the Kabah. A Quraysh mob gathered around him.  They
			seized him and tried to strangle him with his own clothes.
			Fatimah screamed and shouted for help. Abu Bakr rushed to the
			scene and managed to free the Prophet. While he was doing so, he
			pleaded: "Would you kill a man who says, 'My Lord is God?'" Far
			from giving up, the mob turned on Abu Bakr and began beating him
			until blood flowed from his head and face.
		</p>
		<p>
			Such scenes of vicious opposition and harassment against her
			father and the early Muslims were witnessed by the young Fatimah.
			She did not meekly stand aside but joined in the struggle in
			defence of her father and his noble mission. She was still a
			young girl and instead of the cheerful romping, the gaiety and
			liveliness which children of her age  are and should normally be
			accustomed to, Fatimah had to witness and participate in such
			ordeals.
		</p>
		<p>
			Of course, she was not alone in this. The whole of the Prophet's
			family suffered from the violent and mindless Quraysh.	Her
			sisters, Ruqayyah and Umm Kulthum also suffered. They were living
			at this time in the very nest of hatred and intrigue against the
			Prophet. Their husbands were Utbah and Utaybah, sons of Abu Lahab
			and Umm Jamil. Umm Jamil was known to be a hard and harsh woman
			who had a sharp and evil tongue. It was mainly because of her
			that Khadijah was not pleased with the marriages of her daughters
			to Umm Jamil's sons in the first place. It must have been painful
			for Ruqayyah and Umm Kulthum to be living in the household of
			such inveterate enemies who not only joined but led the campaign
			against theft father.
		</p>
		<p>
			As a mark of disgrace to Muhammad and his family, Utbah and
			Utaybah were prevailed upon by their parents to divorce their
			wives. This was part of the process of ostracizing the Prophet
			totally. The Prophet in fact welcomed his daughters back to his
			home with joy, happiness and relief.
		</p>
		<p>
			Fatimah, no doubt, must have been happy to be with her sisters
			once again. They all wished that their eldest sister, Zaynab,
			would also be divorced by her husband. In fact, the Quraysh
			brought pressure on Abu-l Aas to do so but he refused. When the
			Quraysh leaders came up to him and promised him the richest and
			most beautiful woman as a wife should he divorce Zaynab, he
			replied:
		</p>
		<p>
			"I love my wife deeply and passionately and I have a great and
			high esteem for her father even though I have not entered the
			religion of Islam."
		</p>
		<p>
			Both Ruqayyah and Umm Kulthum were happy to be back with their
			loving parents and to be rid of the unbearable mental torture to
			which they had been subjected in the house of Umm Jamil. Shortly
			afterwards, Ruqayyah married again, to the young and shy Uthman
			ibn Allan who was among the first to have accepted Islam. They
			both left for Abyssinia among the first muhajirin who sought
			refuge in that land and stayed there for several years. Fatimah
			was not to see Ruqayyah again until after their mother had died.
		</p>
		<p>
			The persecution of the Prophet, his family and his followers
			continued and even became worse after the migration of the first
			Muslims to Abyssinia. In about the seventh year of his mission,
			the Prophet and his family were forced to leave their homes and
			seek refuge in a rugged little valley enclosed by hills on all
			sides and defile, which could only be entered from Makkah by a
			narrow path.
		</p>
		<p>
			To this arid valley, Muhammad and the clans of Banu Hashim and
			al-Muttalib were forced to retire with limited supplies of food. 
			Fatimah was one of the youngest members of the clans -just about
			twelve years old - and had to undergo months of hardship and
			suffering. The wailing of hungry children and women in the valley
			could be heard from Makkah.  The Quraysh allowed no food and
			contact with the Muslims whose hardship was only relieved
			somewhat during the season of pilgrimage. The boycott lasted for
			three years. When it was lifted, the Prophet had to face even
			more trials and difficulties.  Khadijah, the faithful and loving,
			died shortly afterwards. With her death, the Prophet and his
			family lost one of the greatest sources of comfort and strength
			which had sustained them through the difficult period. The year
			in which the noble Khadijah, and later Abu Talib, died is known
			as the Year of Sadness. Fatimah, now a young lady, was greatly
			distressed by her mother's death.  She wept bitterly and for some
			time was so grief-striken that her health deteriorated. It was
			even feared she might die of grief.
		</p>
		<p>
			Although her older sister, Umm Kulthum, stayed in the same
			household, Fatimah realized that she now had a greater
			responsibility with the passing away of her mother.  She felt
			that she had to give even greater support to her father.  With
			loving tenderness, she devoted herself to looking after his
			needs. So concerned was she for his welfare that she came to be
			called "Umm Abi-ha   the mother of her father".  She also
			provided him with solace and comfort during times of trial,
			difficulty and crisis.
		</p>
		<p>
			Often the trials were too much for her. Once, about this time, an
			insolent mob heaped dust and earth upon his gracious head.  As he
			entered his home, Fatimah wept profusely as she wiped the dust
			from her father's head.
		</p>
		<p>
			"Do not cry, my daughter," he said, "for God shall protect your
			father." The Prophet had a special love for Fatimah. He once
			said: "Whoever pleased Fatimah has indeed pleased God and whoever
			has caused her to be angry has indeed angered God. Fatimah is a
			part of me.  Whatever pleases her pleases me and whatever angers
			her angers me."
		</p>
		<p>
			He also said: "The best women in all the world are four: the
			Virgin Mary, Aasiyaa the wife of Pharoah, Khadijah Mother of the
			Believers, and Fatimah, daughter of Muhammad." Fatimah thus
			acquired a place of love and esteem in the Prophet's heart that
			was only occupied by his wife Khadijah.
		</p>
		<p>
			Fatimah, may God be pleased with her, was given the title of 
			"az-Zahraa" which means "the Resplendent One".	That was because
			of her beaming face which seemed to radiate light. It is said
			that when she stood for Prayer, the mihrab would reflect the
			light of her countenance. She was also called "al-Batul" because
			of her asceticism.  Instead of spending her time in the company
			of women, much of her time would be spent in Salat, in reading
			the Quran and in other acts of ibadah.
		</p>
		<p>
			Fatimah had a strong resemblance to her  father, the Messenger of
			God.  Aishah. the wife of the Prophet, said of her: "I have not
			seen any one of God's creation resemble the Messenger of God more
			in speech, conversation and manner of sitting than Fatimah, may
			God be pleased with her.  When the Prophet saw her approaching,
			he would welcome her, stand up and kiss her, take her by the hand
			and sit her down in the place where he was sitting."  She would
			do the same when the Prophet came to her.  She would stand up and
			welcome him with joy and kiss him.
		</p>
		<p>
			Fatimah's fine manners and gentle speech were part of her lovely
			and endearing personality. She was especially kind to poor and
			indigent folk and would often give all the food she had to those
			in need even if she herself remained hungry. She had no craving
			for the ornaments of this world nor the luxury and comforts of
			life. She lived simply, although on occasion as we shall see
			circumstances seemed to be too much and too difficult for her.
		</p>
		<p>
			She inherited from her father a persuasive eloquence that was
			rooted in wisdom.  When she spoke, people would often be moved to
			tears. She had the ability and the sincerity to stir the
			emotions, move people to tears and fill their hearts with praise
			and gratitude to God for His grace and His inestimable bounties.
		</p>
		<p>
			Fatimah migrated to Madinah a few weeks after the Prophet did.
			She went with Zayd ibn Harithah who was sent by the Prophet back
			to Makkah to bring the rest of his family. The party included
			Fatimah and Umm Kulthum, Sawdah, the Prophet's wife, Zayd's wife
			Barakah and her son Usamah.  Travelling with the group also were
			Abdullah the son of Abu Bakr who accompanied his mother and his
			sisters, Aishah and Asma.
		</p>
		<p>
			In Madinah, Fatimah lived with her father in the simple dwelling
			he had built adjoining the mosque. In the second year after the
			Hijrah, she received proposals of marriage through her father,
			two of which were turned down. Then Ali, the son of Abu Talib,
			plucked up courage and went to the Prophet to ask for her hand in
			marriage. In the presence of the Prophet, however, Ali became
			over-awed and tongue-tied.  He stared at the ground and could not
			say anything. The Prophet then asked: "Why have you come?  Do you
			need something?" Ali still could not speak and then the Prophet
			suggested: "Perhaps you have come to propose marriage to
			Fatimah."
		</p>
		<p>
			"Yes," replied Ali. At this, according to one report, the Prophet
			said simply: "Marhaban wa ahlan - Welcome into the family," and
			this was taken by Ali and a group of Ansar who were waiting
			outside for him as indicating the Prophet's approval.  Another
			report indicated that the Prophet approved and went on to ask Ali
			if he had anything to give as mahr.  Ali replied that he didn't. 
			The Prophet reminded him that he had a shield which could be
			sold.
		</p>
		<p>
			Ali sold the shield to Uthman for four hundred dirhams and as he
			was hurrying back to the Prophet to hand over the sum as mahr,
			Uthman stopped him and said:
		</p>
		<p>
			"I am returning your shield to you as a present from me on your
			marriage to Fatimah." Fatimah and Ali were thus married most
			probably at the beginning of the second year after the Hijrah.
			She was about nineteen years old at the time and Ali was about
			twenty one. The Prophet himself performed the marriage ceremony. 
			At the walimah. the guests were served with dates, figs and hais
			( a mixture of dates and butter fat).  A leading member of the
			Ansar donated a ram and others made offerings of grain. All
			Madinah rejoiced.
		</p>
		<p>
			On her marriage. the Prophet is said to have presented Fatimah
			and Ali with a wooden bed intertwined with palm leaves, a velvet
			coverlet. a leather cushion filled with palm fibre, a sheepskin,
			a pot, a waterskin and a quern for grinding grain.
		</p>
		<p>
			Fatimah left the home of her beloved father for the first time to
			begin life with her husband. The Prophet was clearly anxious on
			her account and sent Barakah with her should she be in need of
			any help. And no doubt Barakah was a source of comfort and solace
			to her. The Prophet prayed for them:
		</p>
		<p>
			"O Lord, bless them both, bless their house and bless their
			offspring." In Ali's humble dwelling, there was only a sheepskin
			for a bed. In the morning after the wedding night, the Prophet
			went to Ali's house and knocked on the door.
		</p>
		<p>
			Barakah came out and the Prophet said to her: "O Umm Ayman, call
			my brother for me."
		</p>
		<p>
			"Your brother?	That's the one who married your daughter?" asked
			Barakah somewhat incredulously as if to say: Why should the
			Prophet call Ali his "brother"? (He referred to Ali as his
			brother because just as pairs of Muslims were joined in
			brotherhood after the Hijrah, so the Prophet and Ali were linked
			as "brothers".)
		</p>
		<p>
			The Prophet repeated what he had said in a louder voice. Ali came
			and the Prophet made a du'a, invoking the blessings of God on
			him. Then he asked for Fatimah. She came almost cringing with a
			mixture of awe and shyness and the Prophet said to her:
		</p>
		<p>
			"I have married you to the dearest of my family to me."  In this
			way, he sought to reassure her. She was not starting life with a
			complete stranger but with one who had grown up in the same
			household, who was among the first to become a Muslim at a tender
			age, who was known for his courage, bravery and virtue, and whom
			the Prophet described as his "brother in this world and the
			hereafter".
		</p>
		<p>
			Fatimah's life with Ali was as simple and frugal as it was in her
			father's household. In fact, so far as material comforts were
			concerned, it was a life of hardship and deprivation. Throughout
			their life together, Ali remained poor because he did not set
			great store by material wealth.  Fatimah was the only one of her
			sisters who was not married to a wealthy man.
		</p>
		<p>
			In fact, it could be said that Fatimah's life with Ali was even
			more rigorous than life in her father's home. At least before
			marriage, there were always a number of ready helping hands in
			the Prophet's household.  But now she had to cope virtually on
			her own. To relieve theft extreme poverty, Ali worked as a drawer
			and carrier of water and she as a grinder of corn. One day she
			said to Ali: "I have ground until my hands are blistered."
		</p>
		<p>
			"I have drawn water until I have pains in my chest," said Ali and
			went on to suggest to Fatimah: "God has given your father some
			captives of war, so go and ask him to give you a servant."
		</p>
		<p>
			Reluctantly, she went to the Prophet who said: "What has brought
			you here, my little daughter?" "I came to give you greetings of
			peace," she said, for in awe of him she could not bring herself
			to ask what she had intended.
		</p>
		<p>
			"What did you do?" asked Ali when she returned alone.
		</p>
		<p>
			"I was ashamed to ask him," she said. So the two of them went
			together but the Prophet felt they were less in need than others.
		</p>
		<p>
			"I will not give to you," he said, "and let the Ahl as-Suffah
			(poor Muslims who stayed in the mosque) be tormented with hunger.
			 I have not enough for their keep..."
		</p>
		<p>
			Ali and Fatimah returned home feeling somewhat dejected but that
			night, after they had gone to bed, they heard the voice of the
			Prophet asking permission to enter. Welcoming him, they both rose
			to their feet, but he told them:
		</p>
		<p>
			"Stay where you are," and sat down beside them. "Shall I not tell
			you of something better than that which you asked of me?" he
			asked and when they said yes he said: "Words which Jibril taught
			me, that you should say "Subhaan Allah- Glory be to God" ten
			times after every Prayer, and ten times "AI hamdu lillah - Praise
			be to God," and ten times "Allahu Akbar - God is Great." And that
			when you go to bed you should say them thirty-three times each."
		</p>
		<p>
			Ali used to say in later years: "I have never once failed to say
			them since the Messenger of God taught them to us."
		</p>
		<p>
			There are many reports of the hard and difficult times which
			Fatimah had to face. Often there was no food in her house. Once
			the Prophet was hungry. He went to one after another of his
			wives' apartments but there was no food.  He then went to
			Fatimah's house and she had no food either.  When he eventually
			got some food, he sent two loaves and a piece of meat to Fatimah.
			At another time, he went to the house of Abu Ayyub al-Ansari and
			from the food he was given, he saved some for her. Fatimah also
			knew that the Prophet was without food for long periods and she
			in turn would take food to him when she could.	Once she took a
			piece of barley bread and he, said to her: "This is the first
			food your father has eaten for three days."
		</p>
		<p>
			Through these acts of kindness she showed how much she loved her
			father; and he loved her, really loved her in return.
		</p>
		<p>
			Once he returned from a journey outside Madinah. He went to the
			mosque first of all and prayed two rakats as was his custom. 
			Then, as he often did, he went to Fatimah's house before going to
			his wives. Fatimah welcomed him and kissed his face, his mouth
			and his eyes and cried. "Why do you cry?" the Prophet asked. "I
			see you, O Rasul Allah," she said, "Your color is pale and sallow
			and your clothes have become worn and shabby." "O Fatimah," the
			Prophet replied tenderly, "don't cry for Allah has sent your
			father with a mission which He would cause to affect every house
			on the face of the earth whether it be in towns, villages or
			tents (in the desert) bringing either glory or humiliation until
			this mission is fulfilled just as night (inevitably) comes." With
			such comments Fatimah was often taken from the harsh realities of
			daily life to get a glimpse of the vast and far-reaching vistas
			opened up by the mission entrusted to her noble father.
		</p>
		<p>
			Fatimah eventually returned to live in a house close to that of
			the Prophet.  The place was donated by an Ansari who knew that
			the Prophet would rejoice in having his daughter as his neighbor.
			 Together they shared in the joys and the triumphs, the sorrows
			and the hardships of the crowded and momentous Madinah days and
			years.
		</p>
		<p>
			In the middle of the second year after the Hijrah, her sister
			Ruqayyah fell ill with fever and measles. This was shortly before
			the great campaign of Badr. Uthman, her husband, stayed by her
			bedside and missed the campaign.  Ruqayyah died just before her
			father returned. On his return to Madinah, one of the first acts
			of the Prophet was to visit her grave.
		</p>
		<p>
			Fatimah went with him. This was the first bereavement they had
			suffered within their closest family since the death of Khadijah.
			 Fatimah was greatly distressed by the loss of her sister. The
			tears poured from her eyes as she sat beside her father at the
			edge of the grave, and he comforted her and sought to dry her
			tears with the corner of his cloak.
		</p>
		<p>
			The Prophet had previously spoken against lamentations for the
			dead, but this had lead to a misunderstanding, and when they
			returned from the cemetery the voice of Umar was heard raised in
			anger against the women who were weeping for the martyrs of Badr
			and for Ruqayyah.
		</p>
		<p>
			"Umar, let them weep," he said and then added: "What  comes from
			the heart and from the eye, that is from God and His mercy, but
			what comes from the hand and from the tongue, that is from
			Satan." By the hand he meant the beating of breasts and the
			smiting of cheeks, and by the tongue he meant the loud clamor in
			which women often joined as a mark of public sympathy.
		</p>
		<p>
			Uthman later married the other daughter of the Prophet, Umm
			Kulthum, and on this account came to be known as Dhu-n Nurayn -
			Possessor of the Two Lights.
		</p>
		<p>
			The bereavement which the family suffered by the death of
			Ruqayyah was followed by happiness when to the great joy of all
			the believers Fatimah gave birth to a boy in Ramadan of the third
			year after the Hijrah. The Prophet spoke the words of the Adhan
			into the ear of the new-born babe and called him  al-Hasan which
			means the Beautiful One.
		</p>
		<p>
			One year later, she gave birth to another son who was
		</p>
		<p>
			called al-Husayn, which means "little Hasan" or the little
			beautiful one. Fatimah would often bring her two sons to see
			their grandfather who was exceedingly fond of them. Later he
			would take them to the Mosque and they would climb onto his back
			when he prostrated.  He did the same with his little
			granddaughter Umamah, the daughter of Zaynab.
		</p>
		<p>
			In the eighth year after the Hijrah, Fatimah gave birth to a
			third child, a girl whom she named after her eldest sister Zaynab
			who had died shortly before her birth. This Zaynab was to grow up
			and become famous as the "Heroine of Karbala".	Fatimah's fourth
			child was born in the year after the Hijrah.  The child was also
			a girl and Fatimah named her Umm Kulthum after her sister who had
			died the year before after an illness.
		</p>
		<p>
			It was only through Fatimah that the progeny of the Prophet was
			perpetuated. All the Prophet's male children had died in their
			infancy and the two children of Zaynab	named  Ali  and  Umamah 
			died  young. Ruqayyah's child Abdullah also died when he was not
			yet two years old.  This is an added reason for the reverence
			which is accorded to Fatimah.
		</p>
		<p>
			Although Fatimah was so often busy with pregnancies and giving
			birth and rearing children, she took as much part as she could in
			the affairs of the growing Muslim community of Madinah.  Before
			her marriage, she acted as a sort of hostess to the poor and
			destitute Ahl as-Suffah. As soon as the Battle of Uhud was over,
			she went with other women to the battlefield and wept over the
			dead martyrs and took time to dress her father's wounds. At the
			Battle of the Ditch, she played a major supportive role together
			with other women in preparing food during the long and difficult
			siege. In her camp, she led the Muslim women in prayer and on
			that place there stands a mosque named Masjid Fatimah, one of
			seven mosques where the Muslims stood guard and performed their
			devotions.
		</p>
		<p>
			Fatimah also accompanied the Prophet when he made Umrah in the
			sixth year after the Hijrah after the Treaty of Hudaybiyyah. In
			the following year, she and her sister Umm Kulthum, were among
			the mighty throng of Muslims who took part with the Prophet in
			the liberation of Makkah.  It is said that on this occasion, both
			Fatimah and Umm Kulthum visited the home of their mother Khadijah
			and recalled memories of their childhood and memories of jihad,
			of long struggles in the early years of the Prophet's mission.
		</p>
		<p>
			In Ramadan of the tenth year just before he went on his Farewell
			Pilgrimage, the Prophet confided to Fatimah, as a secret not yet
			to be told to others:
		</p>
		<p>
			"
		</p>
		<p>
			Jibril recited the Quran to me and I to him once every year, but
			this year he has recited it with me twice.  I cannot but think
			that my time has come."
		</p>
		<p>
			On his return from the Farewell Pilgrimage, the Prophet did
			become seriously ill. His final days were spent in the apartment
			of his wife Aishah.  When Fatimah came to visit him, Aishah would
			leave father and daughter together.
		</p>
		<p>
			One day he summoned Fatimah. When she came, he kissed her and
			whispered some words in her ear. She wept.  Then again he
			whispered in her ear and she smiled. Aishah saw and asked:
		</p>
		<p>
			"You cry and you laugh at the same time, Fatimah?  What did the
			Messenger of God say to you?" Fatimah replied:
		</p>
		<p>
			"He first told me that he would meet his Lord after a short while
			and so I cried. Then he said to me: 'Don't cry for you will be
			the first of my household to join me.' So I laughed."
		</p>
		<p>
			Not long afterwards the noble Prophet passed away. Fatimah was
			grief-striken and she would often be seen weeping profusely. One
			of the companions noted that he did not see Fatimah, may God be
			pleased with her, laugh after the death of her father.
		</p>
		<p>
			One morning, early in the month of Ramadan, just less than five
			month after her noble father had passed away, Fatimah woke up
			looking unusually happy and full of mirth.  In the afternoon of
			that day, it is said that she called Salma bint Umays who was
			looking after her.  She asked for some water and had a bath.  She
			then put on new clothes and perfumed herself.  She then asked
			Salma to put her bed in the courtyard of the house. With her face
			looking to the heavens above, she asked for her husband Ali.
		</p>
		<p>
			He was taken aback when he saw her lying in the middle of the
			courtyard and asked her what was wrong. She smiled and said:  "I
			have an appointment today with the Messenger of God."
		</p>
		<p>
			Ali cried and she tried to console him. She told him to look
			after their sons al-Hasan and al-Husayn and advised that she
			should be buried without ceremony. She gazed upwards again, then
			closed her eyes and surrendered her soul to the Mighty Creator.
		</p>
		<p>
			She, Fatimah the Resplendent One, was just twenty nine years old.

	<biography name="Suhayb ar-Rumi">
		<p>
			About twenty years before the start of the Prophet's mission,
			that is about the middle of the sixth century CE, an Arab named
			Sinan ibn Malik governed the city of al-Uballah on behalf of the
			Persian emperor. The city, which is now part of Basrah, lay on
			the banks of the Euphrates River.  Sinan lived in a luxurious
			palace on the banks of the river. He had several children and was
			particularly fond of one of them who was then barely five years
			old. His name was Suhayb. He was blond and fair-complexioned.  He
			was active and alert and gave much pleasure to his father.
		</p>
		<p>
			One day Suhayb's mother took him and some members of her
			household to a village called ath-Thani for a picnic.  What was
			to be a relaxing and enjoyable day turned out to be a terrifying
			experience that was to change the course of young Suhayb's life
			forever.
		</p>
		<p>
			That day, the village of ath-Thani was attacked, by a raiding
			party of Byzantine soldiers.  The guards accompanying the picnic
			party were overwhelmed and killed.  Ali possessions were seized
			and a large number of persons were taken prisoner. Among these
			was Suhayb ibn Sinan.
		</p>
		<p>
			Suhayb was taken to one of the slave markets of the Byzantine
			Empire, the capital of which was Constantinople, there to be
			sold. Thereafter he passed from the hands of one slave master to
			another. His fate was no different from thousands of other slaves
			who filled the houses, the palaces and castles of Byzantine
			rulers and aristocrats.
		</p>
		<p>
			Suhayb spent his boyhood and his youth as a slave. For about
			twenty years he stayed in Byzantine lands. This gave him the
			opportunity to get a rare knowledge and understanding of
			Byzantine/ire and society. In the palaces of the aristocracy, he
			saw with his own eyes the injustices and the corruption of
			Byzantine life. He detested that society and later would say to
			himself:
		</p>
		<p>
			"A society like this can only be purified by a deluge." Suhayb of
			course grew up speaking Greek, the language of the Byzantine
			Empire.  He practically forgot Arabic.	But he never forgot that
			he was a son of the desert.  He longed for the day when he would
			be free again to join his people's folk. At the first opportunity
			Suhayb escaped from bondage and headed straight for Makkah which
			was a place of refuge or asylum. There people called him Suhayb
			"ar-Rumi" or "the Byzantine" because of his peculiarly heavy
			speech and his blond hair.  He became the halif of one of the
			aristocrats of Makkah, Abdullah ibn Judan. He engaged in trade
			and prospered.	In fact, he became quite rich.
		</p>
		<p>
			One day he returned to Makkah from one of his trading journeys.
			He was told that Muhammad the son of Abdullah had begun calling
			people to believe in God alone, commanding them to be just and to
			do good works and prohibiting them from shameful and
			reprehensible deeds. He immediately enquired who Muhammad was and
			where he stayed. He was told.
		</p>
		<p>
			"(He stays) in the house or' al-Arqam ibn Abi al-Arqam.  Be
			careful however that no Quraysh sees you. If they see you they
			would do (the most terrible things to you). You are a stranger
			here and there is no bond of asabiyyahi to protect you, neither
			have you any clan to help you."
		</p>
		<p>
			Suhayb went cautiously to the house of al-Arqam. At the door he
			found Ammar ibn Yasir the young son of a Yemeni father who was
			known to him. He hesitated for a moment then went up to Ammar and
			said: "What do you want (here), Ammar?" "Rather, what do you want
			here'?" countered Ammar. "I want to go to this man and hear
			directly from him what he is saying." "I also want to do that."
			"Then let us enter together, ala barakatillah (with the blessings
			of God)."
		</p>
		<p>
			Suhayb and Ammar entered and listened to what Muhammad was
			saying.  They were both readily convinced of the truth of his
			message. The light of faith entered their hearts. At this
			meeting, they pledged fealty to the Prophet. declaring that there
			is no god but Allah and Muhammad is the Messenger of Allah. They
			spent the entire day in the company of the noble Prophet. At
			night, under cover of darkness, they left the house of al-Arqam,
			their hearts aglow with the light of faith and their faces
			beaming with happiness.
		</p>
		<p>
			Then the familiar pattern of events followed.  The idolatrous
			Quraysh learnt about Suhayb's acceptance of Islam and began
			harassing and persecuting him. Suhayb bore his share of the
			persecution in	the same way as Bilal, Ammar and his mother
			Sumayyah, Khabbab and many others who professed Islam. The
			punishment was inhuman and severe but Suhayb bore it all with a
			patient and courageous heart because he knew that the path to
			Jannah is paved with thorns and difficulties. The teachings of
			the noble Prophet had instilled in him and other companions a
			rare strength and courage.
		</p>
		<p>
			When the Prophet gave permission for his followers to migrate to
			Madinah, Suhayb resolved to go in the company of the Prophet and
			Abu Bakr. The Quraysh however found out about his intentions and
			foiled his plans. They placed guards over him to prevent him from
			leaving and taking with him the wealth, the gold and the silver,
			which he had acquired through trade.
		</p>
		<p>
			After the departure of the Prophet and Abu Bakr, Suhayb continued
			to bide his time, waiting for an opportunity to join them.  He
			remained unsuccessful. The eyes of his guards were ever alert and
			watchful. The only way out was to resort to a stratagem.
		</p>
		<p>
			One cold night, Suhayb pretended he had some stomach problems and
			went out repeatedly as if responding to calls of nature. His
			captors said one to another:
		</p>
		<p>
			"Don't worry.  Al-Laat and al-Uzza are keeping him busy with his
			stomach."
		</p>
		<p>
			They became relaxed and sleep got the better of them. Suhayb
			quietly slipped out as if he was going to the toilet.  He armed
			himself, got ready a mount and headed in the direction of
			Madinah.
		</p>
		<p>
			When his captors awoke, they realized with a start that Suhayb
			was gone.  They got horses ready and set out in hot pursuit and
			eventually caught up with him. Seeing them approach, Suhayb
			clambered up a hill. Holding his bow and arrow at the ready, he
			shouted: "Men of Quraysh! You know, by God, that I am one of the
			best archers and my aim is unerring. By God, if you come near me,
			with each arrow I have, I shall kill one of you. Then I shall
			strike with my sword." A Quraysh spokesman responded: By God, we
			shall not let you escape from us with your life and money. You
			came to Makkah weak and poor and you have acquired what you have
			acquired.."
		</p>
		<p>
			"What would you say if I leave you my wealth?" interrupted
			Suhayb. "Would you get out of my way?" "Yes," they agreed.
		</p>
		<p>
			Suhayb described the place in his house in Makkah where he had
			left the money, and they allowed him to go.
		</p>
		<p>
			He set off as quickly as he could for Madinah cherishing the
			prospect of being with the Prophet and of having the freedom to
			worship God in peace. On his way to Madinah, whenever he felt
			tired, the thought of meeting the Prophet sustained him and he
			proceeded with increased determination. When Suhayb reached Quba,
			just outside Madinah where the Prophet himself alighted after his
			Hijrah, the Prophet saw him approaching.  He was over-joyed and
			greeted Suhayb with beaming smiles.
		</p>
		<p>
			"Your transaction has been fruitful, O Abu Yahya. Your
			transaction has been fruitful."  He repeated this three times.
			Suhayb's face beamed with happiness as he said: "By God, no one
			has come before me to you, Messenger of God, and only JibriI
			could have told you about this." Yes indeed!   Suhayb's
			transaction was fruitful. Revelation from on high affirmed the
			truth of this:
		</p>
		<p>
			"And there is a type of man who gives his life to earn the
			pleasure of God. And God is full of kindness to His servants."
			(The Quran, Surah al-Baqarah, 2:2O7).
		</p>
		<p>
			What is money and what is gold and what is the entire world so
			long as faith remains!	The Prophet loved Suhayb a great deal. He
			was commended by the Prophet and described as preceding the
			Byzantines to Islam. In addition to his piety and sobriety,
			Suhayb was also light-hearted at times and had a good sense of
			humor. One day the Prophet saw him eating dates. He noticed that
			Suhayb had an infection in one eye. The Prophet said to him
			laughingly: "Do you eat ripe dates while you have an infection in
			one eye?" "What's wrong?" replied Suhayb, "I am eating it with
			the other eye."
		</p>
		<p>
			Suhayb was also known for his generosity. He used to give all his
			stipend from the public treasury fi sabilillah, to help the poor
			and those in distress. He was a good example of the Quranic
			verse: "He gives food for the love of God to the needy, the
			orphan and the captive."  So generous was he that Umar once
			remarked:
		</p>
		<p>
			"I have seen you giving out so much food that you appear to be
			too extravagant." Suhayb replied: "I have heard the Messenger of
			God say: 'The best of you is the one who gives out food.'"
		</p>
		<p>
			Suhayb's piety and his standing among MusIims was so high that he
			was selected by Umar ibn al-Khattab to lead the Muslims in the
			period between his death and the choosing of his successor.
		</p>
		<p>
			As he lay dying after he was stabbed by a Magian, Abu Lulu, while
			leading the Fajr Salat, Umar summoned six of the companions:  
			Uthman, Ali, Talhah, Zubayr, Abdur Rahman ibn Awl, and Sad ibn
			Abi Waqqas.  He did not appoint anyone of them as his successor,
			because if he had done so according to one report "there would
			have been for a short time two Khalifahs looking at each other".
			He instructed the six to consult among themselves and with the
			Muslims for three days and choose a successor, and then he said:
		</p>
		<p>
			"Wa-l yusalli bi-n nas Suhayb - Let Suhayb lead the people in
			Salat."
		</p>
		<p>
			In the period when there was no Khalifah, Suhayb was given the
			responsibility and the honor of leading the Salat and of being,
			in other words, the head of the Muslim community.
		</p>
		<p>
			Suhayb's appointment by Umar showed how well people from a wide
			variety of backgrounds were integrated and honoured in the
			community of Islam. Once during the time of the Prophet, a
			hypocrite named Qays ibn Mutatiyah tried to pour scorn and
			disgrace on sections of the community.	Qays had come upon a
			study circle (halqah)  in which were Salman al-Farsi, Suhayb
			ar-Rumi and Bilal al-Habashi, may God be pleased with them, and
			remarked:
		</p>
		<p>
			"The Aws and the Khazraj have stood up m defence of this man

			Prophet was very angry. He entered the mosque and the Call to
			Prayer was given, for this was the method of summoning the
			Muslims for an important announcement. Then he stood up, praised
			and glorified God and said:
		</p>
		<p>
			"Your Lord is One.  Your ancestor is one.  Your religion is one.

	<biography name="Abu-d Dardaa">
		<p>
			Early in the morning, Abu-d Dardaa awoke and went straight to his
			idol which he kept in the best part of his house. He greeted it
			and made obeisance to it. Then he anointed it with the best
			perfume from his large shop and put on it a new raiment of
			beautiful silk which a merchant had brought to him the day before
			from Yemen.
		</p>
		<p>
			When the sun was high in the sky he left his house for his shop.
			On that day the streets and alleys of Yathrib were crowded with
			the followers of Muhammad returning from Badr. With them were
			several prisoners of war. Abu-d Dardaa surveyed the crowds and
			then went up to a Khazraji youth and asked about the fate of
			Abdullah ibn Rawahah.
		</p>
		<p>
			"He was put through the most severe tests in the battle," "but he
			emerged safely..."
		</p>
		<p>
			Abu-d Dardaa was clearly anxious about his close friend, Abdullah
			ibn Rawahah.  Everyone in Yathrib knew the bond of brotherhood
			which existed between the two men from the days of Jahiliyyah,
			before the coming of Islam to Yathrib.	When Islam came to the
			city, Ibn Rawahah embraced it but Abu-d Dardaa rejected it. This
			however did not rupture the relationship between the two. 
			Abdullah kept on visiting Abu-d Dardaa and tried to make him! see
			the virtues, the benefits and the excellence of Islam. But with
			every passing day, while Abu-d Dardaa remained a mushrik,
			Abdullah felt more sad and concerned.
		</p>
		<p>
			Abu-d Dardaa arrived at his shop and sat cross-legged on a high
			chair. He began trading-buying and selling and giving
			instructions to his assistants unaware of what was going on at
			his house. For at that very time, Abdullah ibn Rawahah had gone
			to the house determined on a course of action. There, he saw that
			the main gate was open. Umm ad-Dardaa was in the courtyard and he
			said to her:
		</p>
		<p>
			"As-salaamu alayki - Peace be unto you, servant of God."
		</p>
		<p>
			"Wa alayka-s salaam - And unto you be peace, O brother of Abu-d
			Dardaa."
		</p>
		<p>
			"Where is Abu-d Dardaa?" he asked. "He has gone to his shop. It
			won't be tong before he returns." "Would you allow me to come
			in?" "Make yourself at home," she said and went about busying
			herself with her household chores and looking after her children.
		</p>
		<p>
			Abdullah ibn Rawahah went to the room where Abu-d Dardaa kept his
			idol. He took out an adz which he had brought with him and began
			destroying the idol while saying:
		</p>
		<p>
			"Isn't everything batil which is worshipped besides Allah?"
		</p>
		<p>
			When the idol was completely smashed, he left the house.  Abu-d
			Dardaa's wife entered the room shortly afterwards and was aghast
			at what she saw. She smote her cheeks in anguish and said: "You
			have brought ruin to me, Ibn Rawahah." When Abu-d Dardaa returned
			home, he saw his wife sitting at the door of the room where he
			kept his idol. She was weeping loudly and she looked absolutely
			terrified. "What's wrong with you?" he asked.
		</p>
		<p>
			"Your brother Abdullah ibn Rawahab visited us in your absence and
			did with your idols what you see." Abu-d Dardaa looked at the
			broken idol and was horrified. He was consumed with anger and
			determined to take revenge. Before long however his anger
			subsided and thoughts of avenging the idol disappeared. Instead
			he reflected on what had happened and said to himself:
		</p>
		<p>
			"If there was any good in this idol, he would have defended
			himself against any injury."
		</p>
		<p>
			He then went straight to Abdullah and together they went to the
			Prophet, peace be on him.  There he announced his acceptance of
			Islam. He was the last person in his district to become a Muslim.
		</p>
		<p>
			From this time onwards, Abu-d Dardaa devoted himself completely
			to Islam. Belief in God and His Prophet animated every fibre of
			his being. He deeply regretted every moment he had spent as a
			mushrik and the opportunities he had lost to do good.  He
			realized how much his friends had learnt about siam in the
			preceding two or three years, how much of the Quran they had
			memorized and the opportunities they had to devote themselves to
			God and His Prophet. He made up his mind to expend every effort,
			day and night to try to make up for what he had missed. Ibadah
			occupied his days and his nights. His search for knowledge was
			restless. Much time he spent memorizing the words of the Quran
			and trying to understand the profundity of its message. When he
			saw that business and trade disturbed the sweetness of his ibadah
			and kept him away from the circles of knowledge, he reduced his
			involvement without hesitation or regret.  Someone asked him why
			he did this and he replied:
		</p>
		<p>
			"I was a merchant before my pledge to the Messenger of God, may
			God bless him and grant him peace. When I became a Muslim, I
			wanted to combine trade (tijarah) and worship (ibadah) but I did
			not achieve what I desired. So I abandoned trade and inclined
			towards ibadah.
		</p>
		<p>
			"By Him in whose hand is the soul of Abu-d Dardaa, what I want to
			have is a shop near the door of the masjid so that I would not
			miss any Salat with the congregation.  Then I shall sell and buy
			and make a modest profit every day."
		</p>
		<p>
			"I am not saying," said Abu-d Dardaa to his questioner, "that
			Allah  Great and Majestic is He has prohibited trade, but I want
			to be among those whom neither trade  nor selling  distracts 
			form  the  remembrance of God ."
		</p>
		<p>
			Abu-d Dardaa did not only become less involved in trade but he
			abandoned his hitherto soft and luxurious life-style. He ate only
			what was sufficient to keep him upright and he wore clothes that
			was simple and sufficient to cover his body.
		</p>
		<p>
			Once a group of Muslims came to spend the night with him.  The
			night was bitterly cold.  He gave them hot food which they
			welcomed. He himself then went to sleep but he did not give them
			any blankets. They became anxious wondering how they were going
			to sleep on such a cold night. Then one of them said: "I will go
			and talk to him." "Don't bother him," said another.
		</p>
		<p>
			However, the man went to Abu-d Dardaa and stood at the door of
			his room.  He saw Abu-d Dardaa lying down.  His wife was sitting
			near to him.  They were both wearing light clothing which could
			not protect them from the cold and they had no blankets. Abu-d
			Dardaa said to his guest: "If there was anything we would have
			sent it to you."
		</p>
		<p>
			During the caliphate of Umar, Umar wanted to appoint Abu-d Dardaa
			as a governor in Syria.  Abu-d Dardaa refused.	Umar persisted
			and then Abu-d Dardaa said:
		</p>
		<p>
			"If you are content that I should go to them to teach them the
			Book of their Lord and the Sunnah of their Prophet and pray with
			them, I shall go."
		</p>
		<p>
			Umar agreed and Abu-d Dardaa left for Damascus. There he found
			the people immersed in luxury and soft living. This appalled him.
			He called the people to the masjid and spoke to them:
		</p>
		<p>
			"O people of Damascus!	You are my brethren in religion,
			neighbors who live together and helpers one to another against
			enemies. "O people of Damascus! What is it that prevents you from
			being affectionate towards me and responding to my advice while I
			do not seek anything from you. Is it right that I see your
			learned ones departing (from this world) while the ignorant among
			you are not learning. I see that you incline towards such things
			which Allah has made you answerable for and you abandon what He
			has commanded you to do.
		</p>
		<p>
			"Is it reasonable that I see you gathering and hoarding what you
			do not eat, and erecting buildings in which you do not live, and
			holding out hopes for things you cannot attain.
		</p>
		<p>
			"Peoples before you have amassed wealth, made great plans and had
			high hopes.  But it was not long before what they had amassed was
			destroyed, their hopes dashed and their houses turned into
			graves. Such were the people of Aad, O people of Damascus. They
			filled the earth with possessions and children.
		</p>
		<p>
			"Who is there who will purchase from me today the entire legacy
			of Aad for two dirhams?"
		</p>
		<p>
			The people wept and their sobs could be heard from outside the
			masjid. From that day, Abu-d Dardaa began to frequent the meeting
			places of the people of Damascus. He moved around in their
			market-places, teaching, answering questions and trying to arouse
			anyone who had become careless and insensitive.  He used every
			opportunity and every occasion to awaken people, to set them on
			the right path.
		</p>
		<p>
			Once he passed a group of people crowding around a man.  They
			began insulting and beating the man. He came up to them and said:
			"What's the matter?" "This is a man who has committed a grave
			sin," they replied.
		</p>
		<p>
			"What do you think you would do if he had fallen into a well?"
			asked Abu-d Dardaa. "Wouldn't you try to get him out?"
			"Certainly," they said. "Don't insult him and don't beat him. 
			Instead admonish him and make him aware of the consequences of
			what he had done.  Then give praise to God Who has preserved you
			from falling into such a sin." "Don't you hate him?" they asked
			Abu-d Dardaa.
		</p>
		<p>
			"I only detest what he had done and if he abandons such practice,
			he is my brother." The man began to cry and publicly announced
			his repentance.
		</p>
		<p>
			A youth once came up to Abu-d Dardaa and said: "Give me advice, O
			companion of the Messenger of God," and Abu-d Dardaa said to him:
		</p>
		<p>
			"My son, remember Allah in good times and He will remember you in
			times of misfortune.
		</p>
		<p>
			"My son, be knowledgeable, seek knowledge, be a good listener and
			do not be ignorant for you will be ruined.
		</p>
		<p>
			"My son, let the masjid be your house for indeed I heard the
			Messenger of God say:  The masjid  is the house of every
			God-conscious person and God Almighty has guaranteed serenity,
			comfort, mercy and  staying on the path leading to His pleasure,
			to those for whom masjids are their houses."
		</p>
		<p>
			On another occasion, there was a group of people sitting in the
			street, chatting and looking at passers-by. Abu-d Dardaa came up
			to them and said:
		</p>
		<p>
			"My sons, the monastery of a Muslim man is his house in which he
			controls himself and lowers his gaze. Beware of sitting in
			market-places because this fritters away time in vain pursuits."
		</p>
		<p>
			While Abu-d Dardaa was in Damascus, Muawiyah ibn Abi Sufyan, its
			governor, asked him to give his daughter in marriage to his
			(Muawiyah's) son, Yazid.  Abu-d Dardaa did not agree.  Instead he
			gave his daughter in marriage to a young man from among the poor
			whose character and attachment to Islam pleased him. People heard
			about this and began talking and asking: Why did Abu-d Dardaa
			refuse to let his daughter marry Yazid? The question was put to
			Abu-d Dardaa himself and he said: "I have only sought to do what
			is good for ad-Dardaa." That was his daughter's name. "How?"
			enquired the person.
		</p>
		<p>
			"What would you think of ad-Dardaa if servants were to stand in
			her presence serving her and if she were to find herself in
			palaces the glamour of which dazzled the eyes?	 What would
			become of her religion then?"
		</p>
		<p>
			While Abu-d Dardaa was still in Syria, the Caliph Umar ibn
			al-Khattab came on an inspection tour of the region. One night he
			went to visit Abu-d Dardaa at his home. There was no light in the
			house. Abu-d Dardaa welcomed the Caliph and sat him down. The two
			men conversed in the darkness.	As they did so, Umar felt Abu-d
			Dardaa's "pillow" and realized it was an animal's saddle.  He
			touched the place where Abu-d Dardaa lay and knew it was just
			small pebbles. He also felt the sheet with which he covered
			himself and was astonished to find it so flimsy that it couldn't
			possibly protect him from the cold of Damascus.  Umar asked him:
		</p>
		<p>
			"Shouldn't I make things more comfortable for you? Shouldn't I
			send something for you?"
		</p>
		<p>
			"Do you remember, Umar," said Abu-d Dardaa, "a hadith which the
			Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace, told us?" "What
			is it?" asked Umar. "Did he not say:  Let what is sufficient for
			anyone of you in this world be like the provisions of a rider?"
			"Yes," said Umar. "And what have we done after this, O Umar?"
			asked Abu-d Dardaa.
		</p>
		<p>
			Both men wept no doubt thinking about the vast riches that had
			come the way of Muslims with the expansion of Islam and their
			preoccupation with amassing wealth and worldly possessions. With
			deep sorrow and sadness, both men continued to reflect on this
			situation until the break of dawn.

	<biography name="Abdur-Rahman ibn Awl">
		<p>
			He was one of the first eight persons to accept Islam. He was one
			of the ten persons (al-asharatu-l mubashshirin) who were assured
			of entering Paradise.  He was one of the six persons chosen by
			Umar to form the council of shura to choose the Khalifah after
			his death.
		</p>
		<p>
			His name in Jahiliyyah days was Abu Amr.  But when he accepted
			Islam the noble Prophet called him Abdur-Rahman - the servant of
			the Beneficent God.
		</p>
		<p>
			Abdur-Rahman became a Muslim before the Prophet entered the house
			of al-Arqam. In fact it is said that he accepted Islam only two
			days after Abu Bakr as-Siddiq did so.
		</p>
		<p>
			Abdur-Rahman did not escape the punishment which the early
			Muslims suffered at the hands of the Quraysh. He bore this
			punishment with steadfastness as they did. He remained firm as
			they did.  And when they were compelled to leave Makkah for
			Abyssinia because of the continuous and unbearable persecution,
			Abdur-Rahman also went. He returned to Makkah when it was rumored
			that conditions for the Muslims had improved but, when these
			rumors proved to be false, he left again for Abyssinia on a
			second hijrah. From Makkah once again he made the hijrah to
			Madinah.
		</p>
		<p>
			Soon after arriving in Madinah, the Prophet in his unique manner
			began pairing off the Muhajirin and the Ansar. This established a
			firm bond of brotherhood and was meant to strengthen social
			cohesion and ease the destitution of the Muhajirin. Abdur-Rahman
			was linked by the Prophet with Sad ibn ar-Rabi'ah.  Sad in the
			spirit of generosity and magnanimity with which the Ansar greeted
			the Muhajirin, said to Abdur-Rahman:
		</p>
		<p>
			"My brother! Among the people of Madinah I have the most wealth. 
			I have two orchards and I have two wives.  See which of the two
			orchards you like and I shall vacate it for you and which of my
			two wives is pleasing to you and I will divorce her for you."
		</p>
		<p>
			Abdur-Rahman must have been embarrassed and said in reply: "May
			God bless you in your family and your wealth. But just show me
			where the suq is.."
		</p>
		<p>
			Abdur-Rahman went to the market-place and began trading with
			whatever little resources he had.  He bought and sold and his
			profits grew rapidly. Soon he was sufficiently well off and was
			able to get married. He went to the noble Prophet with the scent
			of perfume lingering over him.
		</p>
		<p>
			"Mahyarn, O Abdur-Rahman!" exclaimed the Prophet - "mahyam" being
			a word of Yemeni origin which indicates pleasant surprise.
		</p>
		<p>
			"I have got married," replied Abdur-Rahman. "And what did you
			give your wife as mahr?" "The weight of a nuwat in gold."
		</p>
		<p>
			"You must have a walimah (wedding feast) even if it is with a
			single sheep. And may Allah bless you in your wealth," said the
			Prophet with obvious pleasure and encouragement.
		</p>
		<p>
			Thereafter Abdur-Rahman grew so accustomed to business success
			that he said if he lifted a stone he expected to find gold or
			silver under it!
		</p>
		<p>
			Abdur-Rahman  distinguished himself in both the battles of Badr
			and Uhud. At Uhud he remained firm throughout and suffered more
			than twenty wounds some of them deep and severe.  Even so, his
			physical jihad was matched by his jihad with his wealth.
		</p>
		<p>
			Once the Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace, was
			preparing to despatch an expeditionary force. He summoned his
			companions and said:
		</p>
		<p>
			"Contribute sadaqah for I want to despatch an expedition."
			Abdur-Rahman went to his house and quickly returned. "O Messenger
			of God," he said, "I have four thousand (dinars). I give two
			thousand as a qard to my Lord and two thousand I leave for my
			family."
		</p>
		<p>
			When the Prophet decided to send an expedition to distant Tabuk -
			this was the last ghazwah of his life that he mounted - his need
			for finance and material was not greater than his need for men
			for the Byzantine forces were a numerous and well-equipped foe.
			That year in Madinah was one of drought and hardship. The journey
			to Tabuk was long, more that a thousand kilometers. Provisions
			were in short supply.  Transport was at a premium so much so that
			a group of Muslims came to the Prophet pleading to go with him
			but he had to turn them away because he could find no transport
			for them.
		</p>
		<p>
			These men were sad and dejected and came to be known as the
			Bakka'in or the Weepers and the army itself was called the Army
			of Hardship ('Usrah).  Thereupon the Prophet called upon his
			companions to give generously for the war effort in the path of
			God and assured them they would be rewarded. The Muslims'
			response to the Prophet's call was immediate and generous.  In
			the fore front of those who responded was Abdur-Rahman ibn Awl. 
			He donated two hundred awqiyyah of gold whereupon Umar ibn
			al-Khattab said to the Prophet:
		</p>
		<p>
			"I have (now) seen Abdur-Rahman committing a wrong. He has not
			left anything for his family."
		</p>
		<p>
			"Have you left anything for your family, Abdur-Rahman?" asked the
			Prophet.
		</p>
		<p>
			"Yes," replied Abdur-Rahman. "I have left for them more than what
			I give and better." "How much?" enquired the Prophet.
		</p>
		<p>
			"What God and His Messenger have promised of sustenance, goodness
			and reward," replied Abdur-Rahman.
		</p>
		<p>
			The Muslim army eventually left for Tabuk. There Abdur-Rahman was
			blessed with an honor which was not conferred on anyone till
			then.  The time of Salat came and the Prophet, peace be on him,
			was not there at the time. The Muslims chose Abdur-Rahman as
			their imam. The first rakat of the Salat was almost completed
			when the Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace, joined
			the worshippers and performed the Salat behind Abdur-Rahman ibn
			Awl. Could there be a greater honor conferred on anyone than to
			have been the imam of the most honored of God's creation, the
			imam of the Prophets, the imam of Muhammad, the Messenger of God!
		</p>
		<p>
			When the Prophet, peace be on him, passed away, Abdur-Rahman took
			on the responsibility of looking after the needs of his family,
			the Ummahaat al-Muminin.  He would go with them wherever they
			wanted to and he even performed Hajj with them to ensure that all
			their needs  were met.	This is a sign of the trust and
			confidence which he enjoyed on the part of the Prophet's family.
		</p>
		<p>
			Abdur-Rahman's support for the Muslims and the Prophet's wives in
			particular was well-known. Once he sold a piece of land for forty
			thousand dinars and he distributed the entire amount among the
			Banu Zahrah (the relatives of the Prophet's mother Aminah), the
			poor among the Muslims and the Prophet's wives.  When Aishah, may
			God be pleased with her, received some of this money she asked:
		</p>
		<p>
			"Who has sent this money?" and was told it was Abdur-Rahman,
			whereupon she said:
		</p>
		<p>
			"The Messenger of God, may God bless him and grant him peace,
			said:  No one will feel compassion towards you after I die except
			the sabirin (those who are patient and resolute)."
		</p>
		<p>
			The prayer of the noble Prophet that Allah should bestow barakah
			on the wealth of Abdur-Rahman appeared to be with Abdur-Rahman
			throughout his life.  He became the richest man among the
			companions of the Prophet.  His business transactions invariably
			met with success and his wealth continued to grow. His trading
			caravans to and from Madinah grew larger and larger bringing to
			the people of Madinah wheat, flour, butter, cloths, utensils,
			perfume and whatever else was needed and exporting whatever
			surplus produce they had.
		</p>
		<p>
			One day, a loud rumbling sound was heard coming from beyond the
			boundaries of Madinah normally a calm and peaceful city. The
			rumbling sound gradually increased in volume.  In addition,
			clouds of dust and sand were stirred up and blown in the wind.
			The people of Madinah soon realized that a mighty caravan was
			entering the city.  They stood in amazement as seven hundred
			camels laden with goods moved into the city and crowded the
			streets. There was much shouting and excitement as people called
			to one another to come out and witness the sight and see what
			goods and sustenance the camel caravan had brought.
		</p>
		<p>
			Aishah, may God be pleased with her, heard the commotion and
			asked: "What is this that's happening in Madinah?" and she was
			told: "It is the caravan of Abdur-Rahman ibn Awl which has come
			from Syria bearing his merchandise." "A caravan making all this
			commotion?" she asked in disbelief." "Yes, O Umm al-Muminin.
			There are seven hundred camels."
		</p>
		<p>
			Aishah shook her head and gazed in the distance as if she was
			trying to recall some scene or utterance of the past and then she
			said:
		</p>
		<p>
			"I have heard the Messenger of God, may God bless him and grant
			him peace, say: I have seen Abdur-Rahman ibn Awl entering
			Paradise creeping."
		</p>
		<p>
			Why creeping?  Why should he not enter Paradise leaping and at a
			quick pace with the early companions of the Prophet?
		</p>
		<p>
			Some friends of his related to Abdur-Rahman the hadith which
			Aishah had mentioned. He remembered that he had heard the hadith
			more than once from the Prophet and he hurried to the house of
			Aishah and said to her: "Yaa Ammah! Have you heard that from the
			Messenger of God, may God bless him and grant him peace?" "Yes,"
			she replied.
		</p>
		<p>
			"You have reminded me of a hadith which I have never forgotten,"
			he is also reported to have said.  He was so over-joyed and
			added:
		</p>
		<p>
			"If I could I would certainly like to enter Paradise standing.	I
			swear to you, yaa Ammah, that this entire caravan with all its
			merchandise, I will giver sabilillah."
		</p>
		<p>
			And so he did.	In a great festival of charity and righteousness,
			he distributed all that the massive caravan had brought to the
			people of Madinah and surrounding areas.
		</p>
		<p>
			This is just one incident which showed what type of man
			Abdur-Rahman was.  He earned much wealth but he never remained
			attached to it for its own sake and he did not allow it to
			corrupt him.
		</p>
		<p>
			Abdur-Rahman's generosity did not stop there. He continued giving
			with both his hands, secretly and openly.  Some of the figures
			mentioned are truly astounding: forty thousand dirhams of silver,
			forty thousand dinars of gold, two hundred awqiyyah of gold, five
			hundred horses to mujahidin setting out in the path of God and
			one thousand five hundred camels to another group of mujahidin,
			four hundred dinars of gold to the survivors of Badr and a large
			legacy to the Ummahaat al Muminin and the catalogue goes on. On
			account of this fabulous generosity, Aishah said:
		</p>
		<p>
			"May God give him to drink from the water of Salsabil (a spring
			in Paradise)." All this wealth did not corrupt Abdur-Rahman and
			did not change him.  When he was among his workers and
			assistants, people could not distinguish him from them. One day
			food was brought to him with which to end a fast. He looked at
			the food and said:
		</p>
		<p>
			"Musab ibn Umayr has been killed. He was better than me. We did
			not find anything of his to shroud him with except what covered
			his head but left his legs uncovered. . Then God endowed us with
			the (bounties of) the world... I really fear that our reward has
			been bestowed on us early (in this world)." He began to cry and
			sob and could not eat.
		</p>
		<p>
			May Abdur-Rahman ibn Awl be granted felicity among "those who
			spend their substance in the cause of God and follow up not their
			gifts with reminders of their generosity or with injury. For them
			their reward is with their Lord, on them shall be no fear nor
			shall they grieve". (The Quran, Surah al-Baqarah, 2: 262).

	<biography name="Said ibn Zayd">
		<p>
			Zayd the son of Amr stood away from the Quraysh crowd as they
			celebrated one of their festivals. Men were dressed in rich
			turbans of brocade and expensive Yemeni burdabs. Women and
			children were also exquisitely turned out in their fine clothes
			and glittering jewelry. Zayd watched as sacrificial animals,
			gaily caparisoned were led out to slaughter before the Quraysh
			idols. It was difficult for him to remain silent. Leaning against
			a wall of the Kabah, he shouted:
		</p>
		<p>
			"O people of Quraysh! It is God Who has created the sheep. He it
			is Who has sent down rain from the skies of which they drink and
			He has caused fodder to grow from the earth with which they are
			fed. Then even so you slaughter them in names other than His.
			Indeed, I see that you are an ignorant folk."
		</p>
		<p>
			Zayd's uncle al-Khattab, the father of Umar ibn al-Khattab,
			seethed with anger. He strode up to Zayd, slapped him on the race
			and shouted: "Damn you! We still hear from you such stupidity. We
			have borne it until our patience is exhausted."
		</p>
		<p>
			Al-Khattab then incited a number of violent people to harass and
			persecute Zayd and make life extremely uncomfortable for him.
			These incidents which took place before Muhammad's call to
			Prophethood gave a foretaste of the bitter conflict that was to
			take place between the upholders of truth and the stubborn
			adherents of idolatrous practices. Zayd was one of the few men,
			known as hanifs, who saw these idolatrous practices for what they
			were. Not only did he refuse to take part in them himself but he
			refused to eat anything that was sacrificed to idols. He
			proclaimed that he worshipped the God of Ibrahim and, as the
			above incident showed, was not afraid to challenge his people in
			public.
		</p>
		<p>
			On the other hand, his uncle al-Khattab was a staunch follower of
			the old pagan ways of the Quraysh and he was shocked by Zayd's
			public disregard for the gods and goddesses they worshipped. So
			he had him hounded and persecuted to the point where he was
			forced to leave the valley of Makkah and seek refuge in the
			surrounding mountains. He even appointed a band of young men whom
			he instructed not to allow Zayd to approach Makkah and enter the
			Sanctuary.
		</p>
		<p>
			Zayd only managed to enter Makkah in secret. There unknown to the
			Quraysh he met with people like Waraqah ibn Nawfal, Abdullah ibn
			Jahsh, Uthman ibn al-Harith and Umaymah bint Abdul Muttalib, the
			paternal aunt of Muhammad ibn Abdullah. They discussed how deeply
			immersed the Arabs were in their misguided ways. To his friends,
			Zayd spoke thus: "Certainly, by God, you know that your people
			have no valid grounds for their beliefs and that they have
			distorted and transgressed from the religion of Ibrahim. Adopt a
			religion which you can follow and which can bring you salvation."
		</p>
		<p>
			Zayd and his companions then went to Jewish rabbis and Christian
			scholars and people of other communities in an attempt to learn
			more and go back to the pure religion of Ibrahim.
		</p>
		<p>
			Of the four persons mentioned, Waraqah ibn Nawfal became a
			Christian. Abdullah ibn Jahsh and Uthman ibn al-Harith did not
			arrive at any definite conclusion. Zayd ibn Amr however had quite
			a different story. Finding it impossible to stay in Makkah, he
			left the Hijaz and went as far as Mosul in the north of Iraq and
			from there southwest into Syria. Throughout his journeys, he
			always questioned monks and rabbis about the religion of Ibrahim.
			He found no satisfaction until he came upon a monk in Syria who
			told him that the religion he was seeking did not exist any
			longer but the time was now near when God would send forth, from
			his own people whom he had left, a Prophet who would revive the
			religion of Ibrahim. The monk advised him that should he see this
			Prophet he should have no hesitation in recognizing and following
			him.
		</p>
		<p>
			Zayd retraced his steps and headed for Makkah intending to meet
			the expected Prophet. As he was passing through the territory of
			Lakhm on the southern border of Syria he was attacked by a group
			of nomad Arabs and killed before he could set eyes on the
			Messenger of God, may God bless him and grant him peace. However,
			before he breathed his last, he raised his eyes to the heavens
			and said:
		</p>
		<p>
			"O Lord, if You have prevented me from attaining this good, do
			not prevent my son from doing so."
		</p>
		<p>
			When Waraqah heard of Zayd's death, he is said to have written an
			elegy in praise of him. The Prophet also commended him and said
			that on the day of Resurrection "he will be raised as having, in
			himself alone, the worth of a whole people".
		</p>
		<p>
			God, may He be glorified, heard the prayer of Zayd. When Muhammad
			the Messenger of God rose up inviting people to Islam, his son
			Said was in the forefront of those who believed in the oneness of
			God and who affirmed their faith in the prophethood of Muhammad.
			This is not strange for Said grew up in a household which
			repudiated the idolatrous ways of the Quraysh and he was
			instructed by a father who spent his life searching for Truth and
			who died in its pursuit.
		</p>
		<p>
			Said was not yet twenty when he embraced Islam. His young and
			steadfast wife Fatimah, daughter of al-Khattab and sister of
			Umar, also accepted Islam early. Evidently both Said and Fatimah
			managed to conceal their acceptance of Islam from the Quraysh and
			especially from Fatimah's family for some time. She had cause to
			fear not only her father but her brother Umar who was brought up
			to venerate the Kabah and to cherish the unity of the Quraysh and
			their religion.
		</p>
		<p>
			Umar was a headstrong young man of great determination. He saw
			Islam as a threat to the Quraysh and became most violent and
			unrestrained in his attacks on Muslims. He finally decided that
			the only way to put an end to the trouble was to eliminate the
			man who was its cause. Goaded on by blind fury he took up his
			sword and headed for the Prophet's house. On his way he came face
			to face with a secret believer in the Prophet who seeing Umar's
			grim expression asked him where he was going. "I am going to kill
			Muhammad..."
		</p>
		<p>
			There was no mistaking his bitterness and murderous resolve. The
			believer sought to dissuade him from his intent but Umar was deaf
			to any arguments. He then thought of diverting Umar in order to
			at least warn the Prophet of his intentions.
		</p>
		<p>
			"O Umar," he said, "Why not first go back to the people of your
			own house and set them to rights?" "What people of my house?"
			asked Umar.
		</p>
		<p>
			"Your sister Fatimah and your brother-in-law Said. They have both
			forsaken your religion and are followers of Muhammad in his
			religion..."
		</p>
		<p>
			Umar turned and made straight for his sister's house. There he
			called out to her angrily as he approached. Khabbab ibn al-Aratt
			who often came to recite the Quran to Said and Fatimah was with
			them then. When they heard Umar's voice, Khabbab hid in a corner
			of the house and Fatimah concealed the manuscript. But 'Umar had
			heard the sound of their reading and when he came in, he said to
			them: "What is this haynamah (gibbering) I heard?"
		</p>
		<p>
			They tried to assure him that it was only normal conversation
			that he had heard but he insisted: "Hear it I did," he said, "and
			it is possible that you have both become renegades."
		</p>
		<p>
			"Have you not considered whether the Truth is not to be found in
			your religion?" said Said to Umar trying to reason with him.
			Instead, Umar set upon his brother-in-law hitting and kicking him
			as hard as he could and when Fatimah went to the defence of her
			husband, Umar struck her a blow on her face which drew blood.
		</p>
		<p>
			"O Umar," said Fatimah, and she was angry. "What if the Truth is
			not in your religion! I bear witness that there is no god but
			Allah and I bear witness that Muhammad is the Messenger of God."
		</p>
		<p>
			Fatimah's wound was bleeding, and when Umar saw the blood he was
			sorry for what he had done. A change came over him and he said to
			his sister:
		</p>
		<p>
			"Give me that script which you have that I may read it." Like
			them Umar could read, but when he asked for the script, Fatimah
			said to him:
		</p>
		<p>
			"You are impure and only the pure may touch it. Go and wash
			yourself or make ablutions."
		</p>
		<p>
			Thereupon Umar went and washed himself, and she gave him the page
			on which was written the opening verses of Surah Ta-Ha. He began
			to read it and when he reached the verse, 'Verily, I alone am
			God, there no deity but me. So, worship Me alone, and be constant
			in Prayer so as to remember Me, 'he said: "Show me where Muhammad
			is."
		</p>
		<p>
			Umar then made his way to the house of al-Arqam and declared his
			acceptance of Islam and the Prophet and all his companions
			rejoiced.
		</p>
		<p>
			Said and his wife Fatimah were thus the immediate cause which led
			to the conversion of the strong and determined Umar and this
			added substantially to the power and prestige of the emerging
			faith.
		</p>
		<p>
			Said ibn Zayd was totally devoted to the Prophet and the service
			of Islam. He witnessed all the major campaigns and encounters in
			which the Prophet engaged with the exception of Badr. Before
			Badr, he and Talhah were sent by the Prophet as scouts to Hawra
			on the Red Sea coast due west of Madinah to bring him news of a
			Quraysh caravan returning from Syria. When Talhah and Said
			returned to Madinah the Prophet had already set out for Badr with
			the first Muslim army of just over three hundred men.
		</p>
		<p>
			After the passing away of the Prophet, may God bless him and
			grant him peace, Said continued to play a major role in the
			Muslim community. He was one of those whom Abu Bakr consulted on
			his succession and his name is often linked with such companions
			as Uthman, Abu Ubaydah and Sad ibn Abi Waqqas in the campaigns
			that were waged. He was known for his courage and heroism, a
			glimpse of which we can get from his account of the Battle of
			Yarmuk. He said:
		</p>
		<p>
			"For the Battle of Yarmuk, we were twenty four thousand or
			thereabout.  Against us, the Byzantines mobilized one hundred and
			twenty thousand men. They advanced towards us with a heavy and
			thunderous movement as if mountains were being moved. Bishops and
			priests strode before them bearing crosses and chanting litanies
			which were repeated by the soldiers behind them.
		</p>
		<p>
			When the Muslims saw them mobilized thus, they became worried by
			their vast numbers and something of anxiety and fear entered
			theft hearts. Thereupon,
		</p>
		<p>
			Abu Ubaydah stood before the Muslims and urged them to fight.
			"Worshippers of God" he said, "help God and God will help you and
			make your feet firm."
		</p>
		<p>
			"Worshippers of God, be patient and steadfast for indeed patience
			and steadfastness (sabr) is a salvation from unbelief, a means of
			attaining the pleasure of God and a defence against ignominy and
			disgrace."
		</p>
		<p>
			"Draw out your spears and protect yourselves with your shields. 
			Don't utter anything among yourselves but the remembrance of God
			Almighty until I give you the command, if God wills."
		</p>
		<p>
			"Thereupon a man emerged from the ranks of the Muslims and said:
			"I have resolved to die this very hour. Have you a message to
			send to the Messenger of God, may God bless him and grant him
			peace?"
		</p>
		<p>
			"Yes" replied Abu Ubaydah, "convey salaam to him from me and from
			the Muslims and say to him: O Messenger of God, we have found
			true what our Lord has promised us."
		</p>
		<p>
			"As soon as I heard the man speak and saw him unsheathe his sword
			and go out to meet the enemy, I threw myself on the ground and
			crept on all fours and with my spear I felled the first enemy
			horseman racing towards us. Then I fell upon the enemy and God
			removed from my heart all traces of fear. The Muslims engaged the
			advancing Byzantines and continued fighting until they were
			blessed with victory."
		</p>
		<p>
			Said  was  ranked  by  the  Prophet  as one  of the outstanding
			members of his generation. He was among ten of the companions
			whom the Prophet visited one day and promised Paradise. These
			were Abu Bakr, Umar, Uthman, Ali, Abdur-Rahman ibn Awl, Abu
			Ubaydah, Talhah, az-Zubayr, Sad of Zuhrah, and Said the son of
			Zayd the Hanif. The books of the Prophet's sayings have recorded
			his great praises of the Promised Ten (al-'asharatu-l
			mubashshirun) and indeed of others whom on other occasions he
			also gave good tidings of Paradise.

	<biography name="Ubayy ibn Kab">
		<p>
			"O Abu Mundhir! Which verse of the Book of God is the greatest?"
			asked the Messenger of God, may God bless him and grant him
			peace. "Allah and His Messenger know best," came the reply. The
			Prophet repeated the question and Abu Mundhir replied.
		</p>
		<p>
			"Allah, there is no god but He, the Living the Self-Subsisting. 
			Neither slumber overtakes him nor sleep. To Him belongs whatever
			is in the heavens and whatever is on earth, ..." and most likely
			he went on to complete the Verse of the Throne (Ayat al-Kursi).
		</p>
		<p>
			The Prophet smote his chest with his right hand in approval on
			hearing the reply and with his countenance beaming with
			happiness, said to Abu Mundhir. "May knowledge delight and
			benefit you, Abu Mundhir."
		</p>
		<p>
			This Abu Mundhir whom the Prophet congratulated on the knowledge
			and understanding which God had bestowed on him was Ubayy ibn
			Kab, one of his distinguished companions and a person of high
			esteem in the early Muslim community.
		</p>
		<p>
			Ubayy was one of the Ansar and belonged to the Khazraj tribe. He
			was one of the first persons of Yathrib to accept Islam.  He
			pledged allegiance to the Prophet at Aqabah before the Hijrah. 
			He participated in the Battle of Badr and other engagements
			thereafter. Ubayy was one of the select few who committed the
			Quranic revelations to writing and had a Mushaf of his own. He
			acted as a scribe of the Prophet, writing letters for him. At the
			demise of the Prophet, he was one of the twenty five or so people
			who knew the Quran completely by heart. His recitation was so
			beautiful and his understanding so profound that the Prophet
			encouraged his companions to learn the Quran from him and from
			three others. Later, Umar too once told the Muslims as he was
			dealing with some financial matters of state:
		</p>
		<p>
			"O people! Whoever wants to ask about the Quran, let him go to
			Ubayy ibn Kab..." (Umar went on to say that anyone wishing to ask
			about inheritance matters should go to Zayd ibn Thabit, about
			questions of fiqh to Muadh ibn Jabal and about questions of money
			and finance, to himself.)
		</p>
		<p>
			Ubayy enjoyed a special honor with regard to the Quran. One day,
			the Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace, said: "O
			Ubayy ibn Kab!	I have been commanded to show or lay open the
			Quran to you."
		</p>
		<p>
			Ubayy was elated. He knew of course that the Prophet only
			received commands from on high. Unable to control his excitement,
			he asked:
		</p>
		<p>
			"O Messenger of God...Have I been mentioned to you by name?"
			"Yes," replied the Prophet, "by your own name and by your
			genealogy (nasab) in the highest heavens."
		</p>
		<p>
			Any Muslim whose name had been conveyed to the heart of the
			Prophet in this manner must certainly have been of great ability
			and of a tremendously high stature.
		</p>
		<p>
			Throughout the years of his association with the Prophet, Ubayy
			derived the maximum benefit from his sweet and noble personality
			and from his noble teachings. Ubayy related that the Prophet once
			asked him:
		</p>
		<p>
			"Shall I not teach you a surah the like of which has not been
			revealed in the Tawrah, nor in the Injil, nor in the Zabur, nor
			in the Quran?" "Certainly," replied Ubayy.
		</p>
		<p>
			"I hope you would not leave through that door until you know what
			it is," said the Prophet obviously prolonging the suspense for
			Ubayy.	Ubayy continues: "He stood up and I stood up with him. He
			started to speak, with my hand in his. I tried to delay him
			fearing that he would leave before letting me know what the surah
			is. When he reached the door, I asked: "O Messenger of God! The
			surah which you promised
		</p>
		<p>
			to tell me..." He replied:
		</p>
		<p>
			"What do you recite when you stand for Salat?" So, I recited for
			him Fatihatu-l Kitab (the Opening Chapter of the Quran) and he
			said: "(That's) it!  (That's) it!  They are the seven
			oft-repeated verses of which God Almighty has said: We have given
			you the seven oft-repeated verses and the Mighty Quran."
		</p>
		<p>
			Ubayy's devotion to the Quran was uncompromising. Once he recited
			part of a verse which the Khalifah Umar apparently could not
			remember or did not know and he said to Ubayy: "Your have lied,"
			to which Ubayy retorted; "Rather, you have lied."
		</p>
		<p>
			A person who heard the exchange was astounded and said to Ubayy:
			"Do you call the Amir al-Muminin a liar?" "I have greater honor
			and respect for the Amir al-Muminin than you," responded Ubayy,"
			but he has erred in verifying the Book of God and I shall not say
			the Amir al-Muminin is correct when he has made an error
			concerning the Book of God." "Ubayy is right," concluded Umar.
		</p>
		<p>
			Ubayy gave an idea of the importance of the Quran when a man came
			to him and said, "Advise me," and he replied: "Take the Book of
			God as (your) leader (imam).  Be satisfied with it as (your)
			judge and ruler. It is what the Prophet has bequeathed to you.
			(It is your) intercessor with God and should be obeyed..."
		</p>
		<p>
			After the demise of the Prophet, may God bless him and grant him
			peace, Ubayy remained strong in his attachment to Islam and his
			commitment to the Quran and the Sunnah of the Prophet. He was
			constant in his ibadah and would often be found in the mosque at
			night, after the last obligatory Prayer had been performed,
			engaged in worship or in teaching. Once he was sitting in the
			mosque after Salat with a group of Muslims, making supplication
			to God. Umar came in and sat with them and asked each one to
			recite a dua. They all did until finally Ubayy's turn came. He
			was sitting next to Umar. He felt somewhat over-awed and became
			flustered.  Umar prompted him and suggested that he say:
			"Allahumma ighfir lanaa. Allahumma irhamnaa.  O Lord, forgive us,
			O Lord, have mercy on us."
		</p>
		<p>
			Taqwa remained the guiding force in Ubayy's life. He lived simply
			and did not allow the world to corrupt or deceive him. He had a
			good grasp of reality and knew that however a person lived and
			whatever comforts and luxuries he enjoyed, these would all fade
			away and he would have only his good deeds to his credit. He was
			always a sort of warner to Muslims, reminding them of the times
			of the Prophet, of the Muslims' devotion to Islam then, of their
			simplicity and spirit of sacrifice. Many people came to him
			seeking knowledge and advice. To one such person he said.
		</p>
		<p>
			"The believer has four characteristics. If he is afflicted by any
			misfortune, he remains patient and steadfast. If he is given
			anything, he is grateful. If he speaks, he speaks the truth. If
			he passes a judgment on any issue, he is just."
		</p>
		<p>
			Ubayy attained a position of great honor and esteem among the
			early Muslims. Umar called him the "sayyid of the Muslims" and he
			came to be widely known by this title. He was part of the
			consultative group (mushawarah) to which Abu Bakr, as Khalifah,
			referred many problems.  This group was composed of men of good
			sense and judgment (ahl ar-ray) and men who knew the law (ahl
			al-fiqh) from among the Muhajirin and Ansar. It included Umar,
			Uthman, Ali, Abdur Rahman ibn Awl, Muadh ibn Jabal, Ubayy ibn Kab
			and Zayd ibn Harith.  Umar later consulted the same group when he
			was Khalifah. Specifically for fatwas (legal judgments) he
			referred to Uthman, Ubayy and Zayd ibn Thabit.
		</p>
		<p>
			Because of Ubayy's high standing, one might have expected him to
			have been given positions of administrative responsibility, for
			example as a governor, in the rapidly expanding Muslim state.
			(During the time of the Prophet in fact he had performed the
			function of a collector of  sadaqah.)  Indeed, Ubayy once asked
		</p>
		<p>
			"What's the matter with you?  Why don't you appoint me as a
			governor?" "I do not want your religion to be corrupted" replied
			Umar.  Ubayy was probably prompted to put the question to Umar
			when he saw that Muslims were tending to drift from the purity of
			faith and self-sacrifice of the days of the Prophet. He was known
			to be especially critical of the excessively polite and
			sycophantic attitude of many Muslims to their governors which he
			felt brought ruin both to the governors and those under them.
			Ubayy for his part was always honest and frank in his dealings
			with persons in authority and feared no one but God. He acted as
			a sort of conscience to the Muslims.
		</p>
		<p>
			One of Ubayy's major fears for the Muslim ummah was that a day
			would come when there would be severe strife among Muslims.  He
			often became overwhelmed with emotion when he read or heard the
			verse of the Quran." "Say:  He (Allah) has power to send
			calamities on you, from above and below, or to cover you with
			confusion in party strife, giving you a taste of mutual
			vengeance, each from the other." (Surah al-An'am, 6: 65)
		</p>
		<p>
			He would then pray fervently to God for guidance and ask for His
			clemency and forgiveness. Ubayy died in the year 29 AH during the
			caliphate of Uthman.

	<biography name="Salim Mawla Abi Hudhayfah">
		<p>
			In giving advice to his companions, the noble Prophet, peace be
			on him, once said: "Learn the Quran from four persons: Abdullah
			ibn Masud, Salim Mawla Abi Hudhayfah, Ubayy ibn Kab and Muadh ibn
			Jabal."
		</p>
		<p>
			We have read about three of these companions before. But who was
			this fourth companion in whom the Prophet had so much confidence
			that he considered him a hujjah or competent authority to teach
			the Quran and be a source of reference for it?
		</p>
		<p>
			Salim was a slave and when he accepted Islam he was adopted as a
			son by a Muslim who was formerly a leading nobleman of the
			Quraysh. When the practice of adoption (in which the adopted
			person was called the son of his adopted father) was banned,
			Salim simply became a brother, a companion and a mawla (protected
			person) of the one who had adopted him, Abu Hudhayfah ibn Utbah.
			Through the blessings of Islam, Salim rose to a position of high
			esteem among the Muslims by virtue of his noble conduct and his
			piety.
		</p>
		<p>
			Both Salim and Abu Hudhayfah accepted Islam early. Abu Hudhayfah
			himself did so in the face of bitter opposition from his father,
			the notorious Utbah ibn Rabi'ah who was particularly virulent in
			his attacks against the Prophet, peace be upon him, and his
			companions.
		</p>
		<p>
			When the verse of the Quran was revealed abolishing adoption,
			people like Zayd and Salim had to change their names.	Zayd who
			was known as Zayd ibn Muhammad had to be called after his own
			natural father. Henceforth he was known as Zayd ibn Harithah.
			Salim however did not know the name of his father. Indeed he did
			not know who his father was. However he remained under the
			protection of Abu Hudhayfah and so came to be known as Salim
			Mawla Abi Hudhayfah.
		</p>
		<p>
			In abolishing the practice of adoption, Islam wanted to emphasize
			the bonds and responsibilities of natural kinship.   However, no
			relationship was greater or stronger than the bond of Islam and
			the ties of faith which was the basis of brotherhood. The early
			Muslims understood this very well.   There was nobody dearer to
			anyone of them after Allah and His Messenger than their brethren
			in faith.
		</p>
		<p>
			We have seen how the Ansar of Madinah welcomed and accepted the
			Muhajirin from Makkah and shared with them their homes and their
			wealth and their hearts. This same spirit of brotherhood we see
			in the relationship between the Quraysh aristocrat, Abu
			Hudhayfah, and the despised and lowly slave, Salim. They remained
			to the very end of their lives something more than brothers; they
			died together, one body beside the other one soul with the other.
			Such was the unique greatness of Islam. Ethnic background and
			social standing had no worth in the sight of God. Only faith and
			taqwa mattered as the verses of the Quran and the sayings of the
			Prophet emphasized over and over again:
		</p>
		<p>
			"The most honorable of you in the sight of God, is the most
			God-fearing of you," says the Quran.
		</p>
		<p>
			"No Arab has an advantage over a non-Arab except in taqwa
			(piety)," taught the noble Prophet who also said: "The son of a
			white woman has no advantage over the son of a black woman except
			in taqwa."
		</p>
		<p>
			In the new and just society rounded by Islam, Abu Hudhayfah found
			honor for himself in protecting the one who was a slave.
		</p>
		<p>
			In this new and rightly-guided society rounded by Islam, which
			destroyed unjust class divisions and false social distinctions 
			Salim found himself, through his honesty, his faith and his
			willingness to sacrifice, in the front line of the believers. He
			was the "imam" of the Muhajirin from Makkah to Madinah, leading
			them in Salat in the masjid at Quba which was built by the
			blessed hands of the Prophet himself. He became a competent
			authority in the Book of God so much so that the Prophet
			recommended that the Muslims learn the Quran from him.	Salim was
			even further blessed and enjoyed a high estimation in the eyes of
			the Prophet, peace be on him, who said of him.
		</p>
		<p>
			"Praise be to God Who has made among my Ummah such as you."
		</p>
		<p>
			Even his fellow Muslim brothers used to call him "Salim min
			as-Salihin - Salim one of the righteous". The story of Salim is
			like the story of Bilal and that of tens of other slaves and poor
			persons whom Islam raised from slavery and degradation and 'made
			them, in the society of guidance and justice - imams, leaders and
			military commanders.
		</p>
		<p>
			Salim's personality was shaped by Islamic virtues. One of these
			was his outspokenness when he felt it was his duty to speak out
			especially when a wrong was committed.
		</p>
		<p>
			A well-known incident to illustrate this occurred after the
			liberation of Makkah. The Prophet sent some of his companions to
			the villages and tribes around the city. He specified that they
			were being sent as du'at to invite people to Islam and not as
			fighters. Khalid ibn al-Walid was one of those sent out. During
			the mission however, to settle an old score from the days of
			Jahiliyyah, he fought with and killed a man even though the man
			testified that he was now a Muslim.
		</p>
		<p>
			Accompanying Khalid on this mission was Salim and others. As soon
			as Salim saw what Khalid had done he went up to him and
			reprimanded him listing the mistakes he had committed.	Khalid,
			the great leader and military commander both during the days of
			Jahiliyyah and now in Islam, was silent for once.
		</p>
		<p>
			Khalid then tried to defend himself with increasing fervor.  But
			Salim stood his ground and stuck to his view that Khalid had
			committed a grave error. Salim did not look upon Khalid then as
			an abject slave would look upon a powerful Makkan nobleman. Not
			at all. Islam had placed them on an equal footing. It was justice
			and truth that had to be defended. He did not look upon him as a
			leader whose mistakes were to be covered up or justified but
			rather as an equal partner in carrying out a responsibility and
			an obligation.	Neither did he come out in opposition to Khalid
			out of prejudice or passion but out of sincere advice and mutual
			self-criticism which Islam has hallowed. Such mutual sincerity
			was repeatedly emphasized by the Prophet himself when he said:
		</p>
		<p>
			"Ad-dinu an-Nasihah. Ad-din u an-Nasihah. Ad-din u an-Nasihah."
			"Religion is sincere advice. Religion is sincere advice. Religion
			is sincere advice."
		</p>
		<p>
			When the Prophet heard what Khalid had done, he was deeply
			grieved and made long and fervent supplication to his Lord. "O
			Lord," he said, "I am innocent before you of what Khalid has
			done." And he asked: "Did anyone reprimand him?"
		</p>
		<p>
			The Prophet's anger subsided somewhat when he was told:
		</p>

			"Yes, Salim reprimanded him and opposed him." Salim lived close
			to the Prophet and the believers. He was never slow or reluctant
			in his worship nor did he miss any campaign. In particular, the
			strong brotherly relationship which existed between him and Abu
			Hudhayfah grew with the passing days.
		</p>
		<p>
			The Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace, passed away
			to his Lord. Abu Bakr assumed responsibility for the affairs of
			Muslims and immediately had to face the conspiracies of the
			apostates which resulted in the terrible battle of Yamamah. Among
			the Muslim forces which made their way to the central heartlands
			of Arabia was Salim and his "brother", Abu Hudhayfah.
		</p>
		<p>
			At the beginning of the battle, the Muslim forces suffered major
			reverses. The Muslims fought as individuals and so the strength
			that comes from solidarity was initially absent. But Khalid ibn
			al-Walid regrouped the Muslim forces anew and managed to achieve
			an amazing coordination.
		</p>
		<p>
			Abu Hudhayfah and Salim embraced each other and made a vow to
			seek martyrdom in the path of the religion of Truth and thus
			attain felicity in the hereafter. Yamamah was their tryst with
			destiny. To spur on the Muslims Abu Hudhayfah shouted: "Yaa ahl
			al-Quran - O people of the Quran! Adorn the Quran with your
			deeds," as his sword flashed through the army of Musaylamah the
			imposter like a whirlwind. Salim in his turn shouted:
		</p>
		<p>
			"What a wretched bearer of the Quran am I, if the Muslims are
			attacked from my direction. Far be it from you, O Salim! Instead,
			be you a worthy bearer of the
		</p>
		<p>
			With renewed courage he plunged into the battle. When the
			standard-bearer of the Muhajirin, Zayd ibn al-Khattab, fell.
			Salim bore aloft the flag and continued fighting.  His right hand
			was then severed and he held the standard aloft with his left
			hand while reciting aloud the verse of the glorious Quran:
		</p>
		<p>
			"How many a Prophet fought in God's way and with him (fought)
			large bands of godly men! But they never lost heart if they met
			with disaster in God's way, nor did they weaken (in will) nor
			give in. And God loves those who are firm and steadfast." What an
			inspiring verse for such an occasion! And what a fitting epitaph
			for someone who had dedicated his life for the sake of Islam!
		</p>
		<p>
			A wave of apostates then overwhelmed Salim and he fell. Some life
			remained with him until the battle came to an end with the death
			of Musaylamah.	When the Muslims went about searching for their
			victims and their martyrs, they found Salim in the last throes of
			death.	As his life-blood ebbed away he asked them: "What has
			happened to Abu Hudhayfah?" "He has been martyred," came the
			reply. "Then put me to lie next to him," said Salim.
		</p>
		<p>
			"He is close to you, Salim. He was martyred in this same place."
			Salim smiled a last faint smile and spoke no more. Both men had
			realized what they had hoped for. Together they entered Islam.
			Together they lived. And together they were martyred.
		</p>
		<p>
			Salim, that great believer passed away to his Lord. Of him, the
			great Umar ibn al-Khattab spoke as he lay dying: "If Salim were
			alive, I would have appointed him my successor."

		<p>
			"An Abi Hurayrata, radiyallahu anhu, qal.' qala rasul Allahi,
			sallallahu alayhi wa sailam..."
		</p>
		<p>
			Through this phrase millions of Muslims from the early history of
			Islam to the present have come to be familiar with the name Abu
			Hurayrah. In speeches and lectures, in Friday khutbahs and
			seminars, in the books of hadith and sirah, fiqh and ibadah, the
			name Abu Hurayrah is mentioned in. this fashion:  "On the
			authority of Abu Hurayrah, may God be pleased with him who said: 
			The Messenger of God, may God bless him and grant him peace,
			said... ".
		</p>
		<p>
			Through his Prodigious efforts, hundreds of ahadith or sayings of
			the Prophet were transmitted to later generations. His is the
			foremost name in the roll of hadith transmitters.  Next to him
			comes the names of such companions as Abdullah the son of Umar,
			Anas the son of Malik, Umm al-Mumininin Aishah, Jabir ibn
			Abdullah and Abu Said al-Khudri all of whom transmitted over a
			thousand sayings of the Prophet.
		</p>
		<p>
			Abu Hurayrah became a Muslim at the hands of at-Tufayl ibn Amr
			the chieftain of the Daws tribe to which he belonged. The Daws
			lived in the region of Tihamah which stretches along the coast of
			the Red Sea in southern Arabia. When at-Tufayl returned to his
			village after meeting the Prophet and becoming a Muslim in the
			early years of his mission, Abu Hurayrah was one of the first to
			respond to his call. He was unlike the majority of the Daws who
			remained stubborn in their old beliefs for a long time.
		</p>
		<p>
			When at-Tufayl visited Makkah again, Abu Hurayrah accompanied
			him.  There he had the honor and privilege of meeting the noble
			Prophet who asked him: "What is your name?" "Abdu Shams - Servant
			of a Sun," he replied.
		</p>
		<p>
			"Instead, let it be Abdur-Rahman - the Servant of the Beneficent
			Lord," said the Prophet.
		</p>
		<p>
			"Yes, Abdur-Rahman (it shall be) O Messenger of God," he replied.
			However, he continued to be known as Abu Hurayrah, "the kitten
			man", literally "the father of a kitten" because like the Prophet
			he was fond of cats and since his childhood often had a cat to
			play with.
		</p>
		<p>
			Abu Hurayrah stayed in Tihamah for several years and it was only
			at the beginning of the seventh year of the Hijrah that he
			arrived in Madinah with others of his tribe. The Prophet had gone
			on a campaign to Khaybar. Being destitute, Abu Hurayrah took up
			his place in the Masjid with other of the Ahl as-Suffah.  He was
			single, without wife or child. With him however was his mother
			who was still a mushrik. He longed, and prayed, for her to become
			a Muslim but she adamantly refused. One day, he invited her to
			have faith in God alone and follow His Prophet but she uttered
			some words about the Prophet which saddened him greatly. With
			tears in
		</p>
		<p>
			his eyes, he went to the noble Prophet who said to him: "What
			makes you cry, O Abu Hurayrah?" "I have not let up in inviting my
			mother to Islam but she has always rebuffed me. Today, I invited
			her again and I heard words from her which I do not like. Do make
			supplication to God Almighty to make the heart of Abu Hurayrah's
			mother incline to Islam."
		</p>
		<p>
			The Prophet responded to Abu Hurayrah's request and prayed for
			his mother. Abu Hurayrah said: "I went home and found the door
			closed. I heard the splashing of water and when I tried to enter
			my mother said: "Stay where you are, O Abu Hurayrah." And after
			putting on her clothes, she said, "Enter!" I entered and she
			said: "I testify that there is no god but Allah and I testify
			that Muhammad is His Servant and His Messenger."
		</p>
		<p>
			"I returned to the Prophet, peace be on him, weeping with joy
			just as an hour before I had gone weeping from sadness and said:
			"I have good news, O Messenger of Allah. God has responded to
			your prayer and guided the mother of Abu Hurayrah to Islam."
		</p>
		<p>
			Abu Hurayrah loved the Prophet a great deal and found favor with
			him. He was never tired of looking at the Prophet whose face
			appeared to him as having all the radiance of the sun and he was
			never tired of listening to him. Often he would praise God for
			his good fortune and say: "Praise be to God Who has guided Abu
			Hurayrah to Islam." Praise be to God Who has taught Abu Hurayrah
			the Quran."
		</p>
		<p>
			"Praise be to God who has bestowed on Abu Hurayrah the
			companionship of Muhammad, may God bless him and grant him
			peace." On reaching Madinah, Abu Hurayrah set his heart on
			attaining knowledge. Zayd ibn Thabit the notable companion of the
			Prophet reported: "While Abu Hurayrah and I and another friend of
			mine were in the Masjid praying to God Almighty and performing
			dhikr to Him, the Messenger of God appeared. He came towards us
			and sat among us. We became silent and he said: "Carry on with
			what you were doing."
		</p>
		<p>
			"So my friend and I made a supplication to God before Abu
			Hurayrah did and the Prophet began to say Ameen to our dua.
		</p>
		<p>
			"Then Abu Hurayrah made a supplication saying: "O Lord, I ask You
			for what my two companions have asked and I ask You for knowledge
			which will not be forgotten."
		</p>
		<p>
			"The Prophet, peace be on him, said: 'Ameen.' "We then said: 'And
			we ask Allah for knowledge which will not be forgotten, and the
			Prophet replied: 'The Dawsi youth has asked for this before you."
			"With his formidable memory, Abu Hurayrah set out to memorize in
			the four years that he spent with the Prophet, the gems of wisdom
			that emanated from his lips. He realized that he had a great gift
			and he set about to use it to the full in the service of Islam.
		</p>
		<p>
			He had free time at his disposal. Unlike many of the Muhajirin he
			did not busy himself' in the market-places, with buying and
			selling. Unlike many of the Ansar, he had no land to cultivate
			nor crops to tend. He stayed with the Prophet in Madinah and went
			with him on journeys and expeditions.
		</p>
		<p>
			Many companions were amazed at the number of hadith he had
			memorized and often questioned him on when he had heard a certain
			hadith and under what circumstances.
		</p>
		<p>
			Once Marwan ibn al-Hakam wanted to test Abu Hurayrah's power of
			memory. He sat with him in one room and behind a curtain he
			placed a scribe, unknown to Abu Hurayrah, and ordered him to
			write down whatever Abu Hurayrah said.	A year later, Marwan
			called Abu Hurayrah again and asked him to recall the same
			ahadith which the scribe had recorded.	It was found that he had
			forgotten not a single word.
		</p>
		<p>
			Abu Hurayrah was concerned to teach and transmit the ahadith he
			had memorized and knowledge of Islam in general. It is reported
			that one day he passed through the suq of Madinah and naturally
			saw people engrossed in the business of buying and selling.
		</p>
		<p>
			"How feeble are you, O people of Madinah!" he said. "What do you
			see that is feeble in us, Abu Hurayrah?" they asked. "The
			inheritance of the Messenger of God, peace be on him, is being
			distributed and you remain here! Won't you go and take your
			portion?" "Where is this, O Abu Hurayrah?" they asked. "In the
			Masjid," he replied.
		</p>
		<p>
			Quickly they left.  Abu Hurayrah waited until they returned. When
			they saw him, they said: "O Abu Hurayrah, we went to the Masjid
			and entered and we did not see anything being distributed."
			"Didn't you see anyone in the Masjid?" he asked. "O yes, we saw
			some people performing Salat, some people reading the Quran and
			some people discussing about what is halal and what is haram."
			"Woe unto you," replied Abu Hurayrah," that is the inheritance of
			Muhammad, may God bless him and grant him peace."
		</p>
		<p>
			Abu Hurayrah underwent much hardship and difficulties as a result
			of his dedicated search for knowledge. He was often hungry and
			destitute.  He said about himself:
		</p>
		<p>
			"When I was afflicted with severe hunger, I would go to a
			companion' of the Prophet and asked him about an ayah of the
			Quran and (stay with him) learning it so that he would take me
			with him to his house and give food. "One day, my hunger became
			so severe that I placed a stone on my stomach. I then sat down in
			the path of the companions. Abu Bakr passed by and I asked him
			about an ayah of the Book of God. I only asked him so that he
			would invite me but he didn't.
		</p>
		<p>
			"Then Umar ibn al-Khattab passed by me and I asked him about an
			ayah but he also did not invite me. Then the Messenger of God,
			peace be on him, passed by and realized that I was hungry and
			said: "Abu Hurayrah!" "At your command" I replied and followed
			him until we entered his house.  He found a bowl of milk and
			asked his family: "From where did you get this?" "Someone sent it
			to you" they replied. He then said to me: "O Abu Hurayrah, go to
			the Ahl as-Suffah and invite them." Abu Hurayrah did as he was
			told and they all drank from the milk.
		</p>
		<p>
			The time came of course when the Muslims were blessed with great
			wealth and material goodness of every description.  Abu Hurayrah
			eventually got his share of wealth. He had a comfortable home, a
			wife and child. But this turn of fortune did not change his
			personality. Neither did he forget his days of destitution. He
			would "I grew up as an orphan and I emigrated as a poor and
			indigent person. I used to take food for my stomach from Busrah
			bint Ghazwan. I served people when they returned from journeys
			and led their camels when they set out.  Then God caused me to
			marry her (Busrah). So praise be to God who has strengthened his
			religion and made Abu Hurayrah an imam." (This last statement is
			a reference to the time when he became governor of Madinah.)
		</p>
		<p>
			Much of Abu Hurayrah's time would be spent in spiritual exercises
			and devotion to God. Qiyam al-Layl staying up for the night in
			prayer and devotion - was a regular practice of his family
			including his wife and his daughter. He would stay up for a third
			of the night, his wife for another third and his daughter for a
			third. In this way, in the house of Abu Hurayrah no hour of the
			night would pass without ibadah, dhikr and Salat.
		</p>
		<p>
			During the caliphate of Umar, Umar appointed him as governor of
			Bakrain. Umar was very scrupulous about the type of persons whom
			he appointed as governors. He was always concerned that his
			governors should live simply and frugally and not acquire much
			wealth even though this was through lawful means.
		</p>
		<p>
			In Bahrain, Abu Hurayrah became quite rich. Umar
		</p>
		<p>
			heard of this and recalled him to Madinah. Umar thought
		</p>
		<p>
			he had acquired his wealth through unlawful means and
		</p>
		<p>
			questioned him about where and how he had acquired
		</p>
		<p>
			such a fortune. Abu Hurayrah replied: "From breeding horses and
			gifts which I received." "Hand it over to the treasury of the
			Muslims," ordered Umar.
		</p>
		<p>
			Abu Hurayrah did as he was told and raised his hands
		</p>
		<p>
			to the heavens and prayed: "O Lord, forgive the Amir al-Muminin."
			Subsequently, Umar asked him to become governor
		</p>
		<p>
			once again but he declined.  Umar asked him why he
		</p>
		<p>
			refused and he said: "So that my honor would not be besmirched,
			my wealth taken and my back beaten." And he added: "And I fear to
			judge without knowledge and speak
		</p>
		<p>
			without wisdom."
		</p>
		<p>
			Throughout his life Abu Hurayrah remained kind and
		</p>
		<p>
			courteous to his mother. Whenever he wanted to leave
		</p>
		<p>
			home, he would stand at the door of her room and say: As-salaamu
			alaykum, yaa ummataah, wa rahrnatullahi wa barakatuhu, peace be
			on you, mother, and the
		</p>
		<p>
			mercy and blessings of God." She would reply: "Wa alayka-s
			salaam, yaa bunayya, wa rahmatullahi wa barakatuhu - And on you
			be peace, my son, and the mercy and blessings of God." Often, he
			would also say: "May God have mercy on you as you cared for me
			when I was small," and she would reply: "May God have mercy on
			you as you delivered me from error when I was old." Abu Hurayrah
			always encouraged other people to be
		</p>
		<p>
			kind and good to their parents.  One day he saw two men walking
			together, one older than the other. He asked the younger one:
			"What is this man to you?" "My father," the person replied.
		</p>
		<p>
			"Don't call him by his name. Don't walk in front of him and don't
			sit before him," advised Abu Hurayrah.
		</p>
		<p>
			Muslims owe a debt of gratitude to Abu Hurayrah for helping to
			preserve and transmit the valuable legacy of the Prophet, may God
			bless him and grant him peace. He died in the year 59 AH when he
			was seventy-eight years old.

	<biography name="Adiyy ibn Hatim">
		<p>
			In the ninth year of the Hijrah, an Arab king made the first
			positive moves to Islam after years of feeling hatred for it.  He
			drew closer to faith (iman) after opposing and combating it.  And
			he finally pledged allegiance to the Prophet, peace be on him,
			after his adamant refusal to do so.
		</p>
		<p>
			He was Adiyy, son of the famous Hatim at-Taai who was known far
			and wide for his chivalry and fabulous generosity.  Adiyy
			inherited the domain of his father and was confirmed in the
			position by the Tayy people. Part of his strength lay in the fact
			that a quarter of any amount they obtained as booty from raiding
			expeditions had to be given to him.
		</p>
		<p>
			When the Prophet announced openly his call to guidance and truth
			and Arabs from one region after another accepted his teachings,
			Adiyy saw in his mission a threat to his position and leadership.
			Although he did not know the Prophet personally, and had never
			seen him, he developed strong feelings of enmity towards him. He
			remained antagonistic to Islam for close upon twenty years until
			at last God opened his heart to the religion of truth and
			guidance.
		</p>
		<p>
			The way in which Adiyy became a Muslim is a remarkable story and
			he is perhaps the best person to relate it. He said:
		</p>
		<p>
			"There was no man among the Arabs who detested God's Messenger,
			may God bless him and grant him peace, more than I, when I heard
			about him. I was then a man of status and nobility. I was a
			Christian. From my people I took a fourth of their booty as was
			the practice of other Arab kings.
		</p>
		<p>
			When I heard of the Messenger of God, peace be on him, I hated
			him. When his mission grew in strength and when his power
			increased and his armies and expeditionary forces dominated east
			and west of the land of Arabs, I said to a servant of mine who
			looked after my camels:
		</p>
		<p>
			'Get ready a fat camel for me which is easy to ride and tether it
			close to me. If you hear of an army or an expeditionary force of
			Muhammad coming towards this land, let me know.' One evening, my
			servant came to me and said: "Yaa Mawlaya!  What you intended to
			do on the approach of Muhammad's cavalry to your land, do it
		</p>
		<p>
			now." 'Why? May your mother lose you!'
		</p>
		<p>
			'I have seen scouts searching close to the habitations. I asked
			about them and was told that they belonged to the army of
			Muhammad,' he said.
		</p>
		<p>
			'Bring the camel which I ordered you to get ready.' I said to
			him.  I got up then and there, summoned my household (including)
			my children and ordered them to evacuate the land we loved. We
			headed in the direction of Syria to join people of our own faith
			among the Christians and settle among them.
		</p>
		<p>
			We left in too much haste for me to gather together our entire
			household. When I took stock of our situation, I discovered that
			part of my family was missing. I had left my own sister in our
			Najd homelands together with the rest of the Tayy people. I did
			not have any means to return to her.  So I went on with those who
			were with me until I reached Syria and took up residence there
			among people of my own religion.  As for my sister, what I feared
			for her happened.
		</p>
		<p>
			News reached me while I was in Syria that the forces of Muhammad
			entered our habitations and took my sister together with a number
			of other captives to Yathrib. There she was placed with other
			captives in a compound near the door of the Masjid.
		</p>
		<p>
			The Prophet, peace be upon him, passed by her. She stood up
			before him and said: 'Yaa Rasulullah! My father is dead and my
			guardian is not here. Be gracious to me and God will be gracious
			to you.! 'And who is your guardian?' asked the Prophet. 'Adiyy
			ibn Hatim.' she said. 'The one who fled from God and His
			Prophet?' he asked. He then left her and walked on.
		</p>
		<p>
			On the following day, the same thing happened. She spoke to him
			just as she did the day before and he replied in the same manner.
			 The next day, the same thing happened and she despaired of
			getting any concession from him for he did not say anything. Then
			a man from behind him indicated that she should stand up and talk
			to him. She therefore stood up and said:
		</p>
		<p>
			'O Messenger of God!  My father is dead and my guardian is
			absent. Be gracious to me and God will be gracious to you.' I
			have agreed he said. Turning to those about him, he instructed:
			likewise `Let her go for her father loved noble ways, and God
			loves them.' 'I want to join my family in Syria,' she said.
		</p>
		<p>
			"But don't leave in a hurry," said the Prophet, "until you find
			someone you can trust from your people who
		</p>
		<p>
			could accompany you to Syria. If you find a trustworthy person,
			let me know."
		</p>
		<p>
			When the Prophet left, she asked about the man who had suggested
			that she speak to the Prophet and was told that he was Ali ibn
			Abi Talib, may God be pleased with him.  She stayed in Yathrib
			until a group arrived among whom was someone she could trust. So
			she went the Prophet and said:
		</p>
		<p>
			'O Messenger of God!  A group of my people have come to me and
			among them is one I can trust who could take me to my family.'
		</p>
		<p>
			The Prophet, peace be on him, gave her fine clothes and an
			adequate sum of money.	He also gave her a camel and she left
			with the group.
		</p>
		<p>
			Thereafter we followed her progress gradually and waited for her
			return. We could hardly believe what we heard about Muhammad's
			generosity towards her in spite of my attitude to him. By God, I
			am a leader of my people. When I beheld a woman in herhawdaj
			coming towards us, I said: 'The daughter of Hatim! It's she! It's
			she!'
		</p>
		<p>
			When she stood before us, she snapped sharply at me and said:
			'The one who severs the tie of kinship is a wrongdoer. You took
			your family and your children and left the rest of your relations
			and those whom you ought to have protected.'
		</p>
		<p>
			'Yes, my sister,' I said, 'don't say anything but good.' I tried
			to pacify her until she was satisfied. She told me what had
			happened to her and it was as I had heard. Then I asked her, for
			she was an intelligent and judicious person:
		</p>
		<p>
			"What do you think of the mission of this man (meaning Muhammad
			peace be on him)?" "I think, by God, that you should join him
			quickly." she said.  "If he is a Prophet, file one who hastens
			towards him would enjoy his grace. And if he is a king, you would
			not be disgraced in his sight while you are as you are."
		</p>
		<p>
			I immediately prepared myself for travel and set off to meet the
			Prophet in Madinah without any security and without any letter. I
			had heard that he had said: 'I certainly wish that God will place
			the hand of Adiyy in nay hand.'
		</p>
		<p>
			I went up to him. He was in the Masjid. I greeted him and he
			said: 'Who is the man? 'Adiyy ibn Hatim,' I said. He stood up for
			me, took me by the hand and set off towards his home.
		</p>
		<p>
			By God, as he was walking with me towards his house, a weak old
			woman met him. With her was a young child. She stopped him and
			began talking to him about a problem. I was standing (all the
			while). I said to myself: 'By God, this is no king.'
		</p>
		<p>
			He then took me by the hand and went with me until we reached his
			home.  There he got a leather cushion
		</p>
		<p>
			filled with palm fibre, gave it to me said: 'Sit on this!'
		</p>
		<p>
			I felt embarrassed before him and said: 'Rather, you sit on it.'
			'No, you,' he said.
		</p>
		<p>
			I deferred and sat on it. The Prophet, peace be on him, sat on
			the floor because there was no other cushion. said to myself:
		</p>
		<p>
			'By God, this is not the manner of a king!' He then turned to me
			and said: 'Yes, Adiyy ibn Hatim! Haven't you been a "Rukusi"
			professing a religion between Christianity and Sabeanism?' 'Yes,'
			I replied.
		</p>
		<p>
			'Did you not operate among your people on the principle of
			exacting from them a fourth, taking from them what your religion
			does not allow you?'
		</p>
		<p>
			'Yes,' I said, and I knew from that he was a Prophet sent (by
			God). Then he said to me: 'Perhaps, O Adiyy, the only thing that
			prevents you from entering this religion is what you see of the
			destitution of the Muslims and their poverty. By God, the time is
			near when wealth would flow among them until no one could be
			found to take it.
		</p>
		<p>
			'Perhaps, O Adiyy, the only thing that prevents you from entering
			this religion is what you see of the small number of Muslims and
			their numerous foe. By God, the time is near when you would hear
			of the woman setting out from Qadisiyyah on her camel until she
			reaches this house, not fearing anyone except Allah.
		</p>
		<p>
			'Perhaps what prevents you from entering this religion is that
			you only see that sovereignty and power rest in the hands of
			those who are not Muslims. By God, you will soon hear of the
			white palaces of the land of Babylon opening up for them and the
			treasures of Chosroes the son of Hormuz fall to their lot.'
		</p>
		<p>
			'The treasures of Chosroes the son of Hormuz?' I asked
			(incredulously). 'Yes, the treasures of Chosroes the son of
			Hormuz,' he said. Thereupon, I professed the testimony of truth,
			and declared my acceptance of Islam."
		</p>
		<p>
			One report says that when Adiyy saw the simplicity of the
			Prophet's life-style, he said to him: "I testify that you do not
			seek high office in this world nor corruption," and he announced
			his acceptance of Islam.  Some people observed the Prophet's
			treatment of Adiyy and said to him:
		</p>
		<p>
			"O Prophet of God! We have seen you do something which you have
			not done to any other." "Yes," replied the Prophet. "This is a
			man of stature among his people. If such a person come to you,
			treat him honorably."
		</p>
		<p>
			Adiyy ibn Hatim, may God be pleased with him, lived for a long
			time. He later said: "Two of the things (which the Prophet spoke
			of) came to pass and there remained a third.  By God, it would
			certainly come to pass. "I have seen the woman leaving Qadisiyyah
			on her camel fearing nothing until she arrived at this house (of
			the Prophet in Madinah).

			The tribe of Muzaynah had their habitations some distance from
			Yathrib on the caravan route which linked the city to Makkah. 
			News of the Prophet's arrival in Yathrib spread rapidly and soon
			reached the Muzaynah through members of the tribe who had left
			and returned.
		</p>
		<p>
			One evening the chieftain of the tribe, an-Numan ibn Maqarrin,
			sat among the elders and other members of the tribe and addressed
			them:
		</p>
		<p>
			"O my people, by God, we have learnt only good about Muhammad,
			and of His mission we have heard nothing but mercy, kindness and
			justice. What's wrong with us? Why do we tarry while people are
			hastening to him?" "As for myself," he continued, "I have made up
			my mind to leave early in the morning to join him. Whoever of you
			wishes to go with me, let him get ready."
		</p>
		<p>
			An-Numan must have been a persuasive chieftain. His words had a
			wondrous effect on the ears of his people. The following morning
			an-Numan's ten brothers and four hundred horsemen of the Muzaynah
			were all ready and prepared to go with him to Yathrib to meet the
			Prophet, may God bless him and grant him peace, and enter the
			religion of Islam.
		</p>
		<p>
			An-Numan however felt embarrassed to go to the Prophet with such
			a numerous following without carrying any presents for him and
			the Muslims. There wasn't much he could carry anyway. That year
			was a year of drought and famine for the Muzaynah and much of
			their livestock and crops had perished. Still, an-Numan went
			around the dwellings of his fellow tribesmen and gathered up
			whatever sheep and goats were left. These he drove before him and
			made his way to Madinah. There in the presence of the Prophet, he
			and his fellow tribesmen announced their acceptance of Islam.
		</p>
		<p>
			The whole of Madinah was agog with excitement with the coming of
			an-Numan and his companions. Never before had there been a single
			family with all eleven brothers accepting Islam at the same time
			together with four hundred horsemen. The noble Prophet was
			exceedingly glad and rejoiced greatly. Indeed the sincerity of
			their effort was accepted and commended by God Almighty when He
			revealed the following words of the Quran to the Prophet:
		</p>
		<p>
			"And among the nomad Arabs are such as believe in God and the
			Last Day, and regard all that they spend in God's cause as a
			means of drawing them nearer to God and of (their being
			remembered in) the Apostle's prayers.  Oh, verily, it shall
			(indeed) be a means of (God's) nearness to them, (for) God will
			admit them into His grace.  Verily God is much-Forgiving, most
			Merciful." (The Quran, Surah at-Tawbah, 9:99).
		</p>
		<p>
			An-Numan lived under the guidance of the Prophet and participated
			in all the campaigns he waged with valor and dedication. In the
			time of Abu Bakr, he and the people of Muzaynah played a major
			and commendable role in putting an end to the fitnah of apostasy.
			During the caliphate of Umar al-Faruq, an-Numan distinguished
			himself, in particular, in the encounters with the Sasananian
			Empire.
		</p>
		<p>
			Shortly before the Battle of Qadisiyyah, the commander of the
			Muslim forces Sad ibn Abi Waqqas sent a delegation to the
			Sasanian Emperor, Yazdagird. The delegation was headed by
			an-Numan ibn Muqarrin and its main purpose was to invite the
			emperor of Islam. When an-Numan and his delegation reached
			Ctesiphon, the Sasanian capital, the people of the city looked
			upon them with curiosity and some disdain.  They remarked on
			their simple appearance, their rough clothes and shoes and their
			weak-looking horses. The Muslims were in no way overwhelmed and
			sought an audience with Yazdagird. He granted them permission,
			summoned an interpreter and said to him:
		</p>
		<p>
			"Say to them (the Muslims): why have you come to our dominions
			and why do you want to invade us? Perhaps, you have designs on
			us... and seek to venture against us because we are preoccupied
			with you. But we
		</p>
		<p>
			do not wish to inflict punishment on you." An-Numan turned to his
			men and said:
		</p>
		<p>
			"If you wish, I shall reply to him on your behalf. But if any one
			of you wants to speak let him do so first." The Muslims told
			an-Numan to speak and turning to the Emperor, said: "This man
			speaks with our tongue so do listen to what he says." An-Numan
			began by praising and glorifying God and invoking peace and
			blessings on His Prophet. Then he said:
		</p>
		<p>
			"Indeed God has been Kind and Merciful to us and has sent to us a
			Messenger to show us the good and command us to follow it; to
			make us realize what is evil and forbade us from it.
		</p>
		<p>
			"The Messenger promised us if we were to respond to what he
			summoned us, God would bestow on us the good of this world and
			the good of the hereafter.
		</p>
		<p>
			"Not much time has elapsed but God has given us abundance in
			place of hardship, honor in place of humiliation and mercy and
			brotherhood in place of our former enmity.
		</p>
		<p>
			"The Messenger has commanded us to  summon mankind to what is
			best for them and to begin with those who are our neighbors.
		</p>
		<p>
			"We therefore invite you to enter into our religion. It is a
			religion which beautifies and promotes all good and which detests
			and discourages all that is ugly and reprehensible. It is a
			religion which leads its adherents from the darkness of tyranny
			and unbelief to the light and justice of faith."
		</p>
		<p>
			"Should you respond positively to us and come to Islam, it would
			be our duty to introduce the Book of God in your midst and help
			you to live according to it and rule according to its laws.  We
			would then return and leave you to conduct your own affairs.
		</p>
		<p>
			"Should you refuse, however, to enter the religion of God, we
			would take the jizyah from you and give you protection in return.
			If you refuse to give the jizyah, we shall declare war on you."
		</p>
		<p>
			Yazdagird was angry and furious at what he had heard and said in
			ridicule: "Certainly I do not know of a nation on earth who is
			more wretched than you and whose numbers are so few, who are more
			divided and whose condition is more evil."
		</p>
		<p>
			"We have been used to delegate your affairs to our provincial
			governors and they exacted obedience form you on our behalf."
			Then softening his tone somewhat, he continued, but with greater
			sarcasm:
		</p>
		<p>
			"If there is any need which has pushed you to come to us, we
			would enlist forces to help you make your lands fertile.  We
			would clothe your leaders and the notables of your people and
			place a king from among ourselves over you who would be gentle to
			you."
		</p>
		<p>
			One of an-Numan's delegation responded sharply to this and
			Yazdagird flew into a rage once more and shouted: "Were it for
			the fact that ambassadors are not killed, I would kill you all.
			"Get up. You shall have nothing from me. And tell your commander
			that I am sending Rustum against him to bury him and you together
			in the ditch of al Qadisiyyah."
		</p>
		<p>
			Yazdagird then called for a basketful of earth and ordered that
			it should be borne outside the city gates by the one whom the
			Muslims considered to be the most noble among them as a sign of
			humiliation. Asim the son of Umar accepted the load as a happy
			augury and took it to the commander-in-chief, Sad ibn Abi Waqqas,
			and said to him:
		</p>
		<p>
			"Accept our congratulations for the victory.  The enemy has
			voluntarily surrendered his territory to us." The Battle of
			Qadisiyyah ensued and after four days of bitter fighting, the
			Muslim forces emerged victorious. The victory paved the way for
			the Muslim advance into the plains of the Euphrates and the
			Tigris. The Persian capital, Ctesiphon, fell and this was
			followed by a number of engagements as the Persians withdrew
			northwards.
		</p>
		<p>
			Despite other defeats and setbacks, Yazdagird refused to yield
			and constantly organized new levies to attack the Muslims and
			foment insurrection in the provinces which had come under Muslim
			control.
		</p>
		<p>
			Umar had counselled moderation on his generals and ordered them
			not to press too far eastwards. However he received news of a
			massive Persian mobilization of about 15O,OOO warriors against
			the Muslims. He thought of leaving Madinah and facing the massive
			threat himself. He was advised against this by prominent Muslims
			in  Madinah who suggested instead that he should appoint a
			military commander to confront the grave situation.
		</p>
		<p>
			"Show me a man whom I can appoint for this task." said. "You know
			your army best, O Amir al-Muminin," they replied and after some
			thought Umar exclaimed:
		</p>
		<p>
			"By God, I shall appoint as commander-in-chief of the Muslim army
			a man who, when the two armies meet, will be the most active. He
			is an-Numan ibn Muqarrin al-Muzani." To him, Umar despatched a
			letter: "From the servant of God, Umar ibn al-Khattab, to
			an-Numan ibn Muqarrin:
		</p>
		<p>
			"I have received news that large numbers of Persians
		</p>
		<p>
			have gathered to fight you in the city of Nihawand.
		</p>
		<p>
			When this my letter reaches you go forward (to confront
		</p>
		<p>
			them) with the help of God, with whoever of the
		</p>
		<p>
			Muslims are with you. Don't take the Muslims over too
		</p>
		<p>
			difficult terrain lest they may be hurt, for one Muslim
		</p>
		<p>
			person is dearer to me than a hundred thousand dinars.
		</p>
		<p>
			And Peace be unto you."
		</p>
		<p>
			An-Numan responded to the orders of the Amir al-Muminin and
			mobilized the Muslim forces.  He despatched an advanced
			detachment of cavalry to reconnoiter the approaches of the city.
			Just outside Nihawand, the horses stopped and despite prodding
			would go no further.  The riders dismounted and discovered iron
			nails in the horses' hooves.  They looked around and found that
			all approaches to the city were strewn with these iron spikes to
			halt the advance of the Muslim army. On being informed of this,
			an-Numan ordered the
		</p>
		<p>
			horsemen to remain where they were and at nightfall to light
			fires for the enemy to see them. They were also to feign fear and
			defeat in order to entice the enemy to come out to them and in
			the process clear the approaches of the iron spikes. The ruse
			worked.  When the Persians saw the van guard of the Muslim army
			appearing dejected and defeated before them, they sent workers to
			clear the area of the spikes. These workers were captured by the
			Muslim cavalry who gained control of the approaches to the city.
		</p>
		<p>
			An-Numan pitched camp on the outskirts of the city and decided to
			make a determined assault on the city. He addressed his soldiers:
			"I shall say Allahu Akbar three times.	At the first time, get
			Yourselves ready (by performing your toilet and making wudu). At
			the second time, let every man of you get ready his weapons and
			gird them on. And the third time, I shall move against the
			enemies of God and you must join in the attack with me." He went
			on:
		</p>
		<p>
			"And if an-Numan is killed, let no one tarry over him. For I
			shall (now) make a supplication to God Almighty and I want
			everyone of you to say 'Ameen'. "He then prayed: "May God grant
			martyrdom to an-Numan this day and may He grant victory to the
			Muslims."
		</p>
		<p>
			Three times an-Numan shouted Allahu Akbar.  On the third time, he
			plunged into the ranks of the enemies and the Muslims rushed on
			behind him. They were outnumbered six to one but inflicted
			terrible losses on the Persians.
		</p>
		<p>
			An-Numan received a mortal blow during the battle. His brother
			took the standard from his hand, and covered him with a burdah
			and concealed his death from the others.
		</p>
		<p>
			The Muslim forces emerged victorious. The Persians never
			recovered themselves after this battle which Muslim historians
			have called "the Victory of Victories".
		</p>
		<p>
			The battle over, the victorious soldiers asked for their valiant
			commander.  His brother lifted the burdab and said: "This is your
			Amir.  God has shown him victory and blessed him with martyrdom."
		</p>
		<p>
			When the news was brought to Umar in Madinah, a companion who was
			with him said: "I saw Umar, may God be pleased with him. When he
			heard of the death of an-Numan ibn Muqarrin, he placed his head
			in his hands and began to cry."

			Umar ibn al-Kattab, the head of the rapidly expanding Muslim
			State went to bed early just after the Salat al-Isha. He wanted
			to have a rest and feel refreshed for his nightly tour of
			inspection of the capital city which he often did incognito. 
			Before he could/all asleep however, the post from the outlying
			regions of the State arrived informing him that the Persian
			forces confronting the Muslims were proving especially difficult
			to subdue. They were able to send in reinforcements and supplies
			from many places to relieve their armies on the point of defeat. 
			The letter urged Umar to send reinforcements and in particular it
			said:
		</p>
		<p>
			"The city of al-Ubullah must be considered one of the most
			important sources providing men and material to the Persian
			forces under attack."
		</p>
		<p>
			Umar decided then to despatch an army to take the city of
			al-Ubullah and cut off its line of supplies to the Persian
			armies.  His main problem was that he had so few men left with
			him in the city.  That was because young men, men of maturity and
			even old men had gone out on campaigns far and wide in the path
			of God, fi sabilillah.
		</p>
		<p>
			In these circumstances he determined to follow the strategy which
			he knew and which was well-tried that is, to mobilize a small
			force and place it under the leadership of a strong and able
			commander. He considered, one after another the names of the
			individuals who were still with him, to see who was the most
			suitable commander. Finally, he exclaimed himself: "I have found
			him. Yes I have found him."
		</p>
		<p>
			He then went back to bed:  The person he had in mind was a
			well-known mujahid who had fought at Badr, Uhud, al-Khandaq and
			other battles. He had also fought in  the  terrible  battles of
			Yamamah and emerged unscathed.	He was in fact one of the first
			to accept Islam. He went on the first hijrah to Abyssinia but had
			returned to stay with the Prophet in Makkah. He then went on
			hijrah to Madinah.  This tall and imposing companion of the
			Prophet was known for his exceptional skill in the use of spears
			and arrows.
		</p>
		<p>
			When morning came, Umar called his attendants and said: "Call
			Utbah ibn Ghazwan for me," Umar managed to put together an army
			of just over three hundred men and he appointed Utbah as their
			commander with the promise that he would send reinforcements to
			him as soon as possible.
		</p>
		<p>
			When the army was assembled in ranks ready to depart, Umar
			al-Faruq stood before them bidding them farewell and giving
			instructions to his commander, Utbah.  He said: "Utbah, I am
			sending you to the land of al-Ubullah. It is one of the major
			fortresses of the enemy and I pray that God helps you to take it.
			When you reach the city, invite its inhabitants to the worship of
			God.  If they respond to you, accept them (as Muslims).  If they
			refuse, then take from them the jizyah.. If they refuse to pay
			the jizyah then fight them... And fear God, O Utbah, in the
			discharge of your duties. Beware of letting yourself become too
			haughty or arrogant for this will corrupt your hereafter.  Know
			that you were a companion of the Messenger of God, may God bless
			him and grant him peace. God honoured you through him after your
			being insignificant. He strengthened you through him after you
			were weak.  You have become a commander with authority and a
			leader who must be obeyed. What a great blessing if this does not
			make you vain and deceive you and lead you to Jahannam. May God
			protect you and me from it."
		</p>
		<p>
			With this chastening advice and prayer, Utbah and his army set
			off. Several women were in the army including his wife and the
			wives and sisters of other men. Eventually they reached a place
			called Qasbaa not very far from al-Ubullah.  It was called Qasbaa
			because of the abundance of reed-like stalks which grew there.
		</p>
		<p>
			At that point the army was absolutely famished. They had nothing
			to eat. When hunger gripped them, Utbah ordered some of his men
			to go and search the land for something to eat.  One of the men
			told the story of their search of food:
		</p>
		<p>
			"While we were searching for something to eat, we entered a
			thicket and, lo and behold there were two large baskets. In one
			there were dates and in the other small white grains covered with
			a yellow husk. We dragged the baskets with the grain and said:
			"This is poison which the enemy has prepared for you. Don't go
			near it all."
		</p>
		<p>
			We went for the dates and began eating from it. While we were
			busy eating the dates, a horse which had broken loose from its
			tether went up to the basket of grain and began eating from it. 
			By God, we seriously thought of slaughtering it before it should
			die (from the alleged poison) and benefit from its meat. However,
			its owner came up to us and said: "Leave it.  I shall look after
			it for the night and if I feel that it is going to die, I will
			slaughter it."
		</p>
		<p>
			In the morning we found the horse quite healthy with no sign of
			ill effects. My sister then said: 'Yaa akhi, I have heard my
			father saying: Poison does not harm (food) if it is placed on
			fire and cooked well.'
		</p>
		<p>
			We then took some of the grain, placed it in a pot and put it on
			a fire. After a short while my sister called out: 'Come and see
			how it has become red and the husks have begun to separate
			leaving white grains.'
		</p>
		<p>
			We placed the white grains in a large bowl and Utbah said to us:
			'Mention the name of Allah on it and eat it.' We ate and found it
			exceedingly delicious and good. We learnt after that the grain
			was called rice."
		</p>
		<p>
			The army of Utbah then went on to the fortified city of
			al-Ubullah on the banks of the River Euphrates. The Persians used
			al-Ubullah as a massive arms depot. There were several fortresses
			in the city from which towers sprang. These were used as
			observation posts to detect any hostile movements outside the
			city.
		</p>
		<p>
			The city appeared to be impregnable. What chance had Utbah of
			taking it with such a small force armed with only swords and
			spears?  A direct assault was obviously futile and so Utbah had
			to resort to some stratagem.
		</p>
		<p>
			Utbah had flags prepared which he had hung on spears. These he
			gave to the women and ordered them to march behind the army. His
			instructions to them then were: "When we get near to the city,
			raise the dust behind us so that the entire atmosphere is filled
			with it."
		</p>
		<p>
			As they neared al-Ubullah, a Persian force came out to confront
			them, they saw the Muslims boldly advancing, the flags fluttering
			behind them and the dust which was being churned up and which
			filled the air around. They thought that the Muslims in front of
			the flags were merely the vanguard of the advancing army, a
			strong and numerous army. They felt they would be no match for
			such a foe. They lost heart and prepared to evacuate the city.
			Picking up whatever valuables they could, they rushed to boats
			anchored on the river and abandoned their well-fortified city.
		</p>
		<p>
			Utbah entered al-Ubullah without losing any of his men. From this
			base he managed to bring surrounding towns and villages under
			Muslim control.  When news spread of Utbah's successes, and of
			the richness of the land he had occupied, many people flocked to
			the region in search of wealth and easy living.
		</p>
		<p>
			Uqbah noted that many Muslims now inclined towards a soft life
			and followed the ways and customs of the region and that this
			weakened their determination to continue struggling.
		</p>
		<p>
			He wrote to Umar ibn al-Khattab asking for permission to build
			the garrison town of Basrah. He described the locations he had
			chosen for the city and Umar gave his assent. Basrah lay between
			the desert and the ports of the Gulf and from this base
			expeditions were launched further east. The positioning of the
			town was for maximum military effectiveness (not merely to
			support an army of occupation).
		</p>
		<p>
			Utbah himself planned the city and built its first great masjid
			which was a simple enclosure, roofed over at one end and suitable
			for mass assemblies.  From the mosque, Utbah and his men went out
			on military campaigns.	These men eventually settled on the land
			and built houses.
		</p>
		<p>
			Utbah himself however did not build a house for himself but
			continued to live in a tent of cloth. He had seen how
			preoccupation with worldly possessions had caused many people to
			forget themselves and their real purpose in life. He had seen how
			men who not long ago knew no food better than rice boiled in
			their husks, getting accustomed to sophisticated Persian
			patisserie like fasludhanj and lawzinaj made with refined flour,
			butter, honey and nuts of various kinds to the point where they
			hankered after these things.
		</p>
		<p>
			Utbah was afraid that his din would be affected by his dunya and
			he was concerned about his hereafter. He called men to the masjid
			of Basrah and addressed them thus: "O people! The dunya will come
			to an end and you will be carried from it to an abode which will
			not wane or disappear.	Go to it with the best of your deeds. I
			look back and see myself among the early Muslims with the
			Messenger of Allah may God bless him and grant him peace. We had
			no food then apart from the leaves of trees and our lips would
			fester. One day I found a burdah. I tore it in two and shared it
			with Sad ibn Abi Waqqas. I made an aazar with one half and he did
			the same with the other half. Here we are today. There is not one
			of us but he is an amir of one of the garrison towns. I seek
			Allah's protection lest I become great in my own estimation and
			little in the sight of Allah.." With these words Utbah appointed
			someone else to stand in his place, and bade farewell to the
			people of Basrah.
		</p>
		<p>
			It was the season of pilgrimage and he left to perform the Hajj. 
			He then travelled to Madinah and there he asked Umar to relieve
			him of the responsibility of governing the city. Umar refused. He
			could not easily dispense with a governor of the quality of Utbah
			and said to him:
		</p>
		<p>
			"You place your trusts and your responsibilities on my neck and
			then you abandon me to myself. No, by God, I shall never relieve
			you." So Umar prevailed upon him and commanded him to return to
			Basrah, Utbah knew that he had to obey the Amir al-Muminin but he
			did so with a heavy heart. He mounted his camel and on his way he
			prayed:
		</p>
		<p>
			"O Lord, do not send me back to Basrah. O Lord, do not send me
			back to Basrah." He had not gone far from Madinah when his camel
			stumbled. Utbah fell and the injuries he sustained proved to be
			fatal.

	<biography name="Abu Musa al-Ashari">
		<p>
			When he went to Basrah as governor of the city, he called the
			inhabitants to a meeting and addressed them: "The Amir
			al-Muminin, Umar, has sent me to you to teach you the Book of
			your Lord and the Sunnah of His Prophet and to clean your streets
			for you."
		</p>
		<p>
			People were taken aback when they heard these words. They could
			easily understand that one of the responsibilities of a Muslim
			ruler was to instruct people in their religion.  However, that
			one of his duties should be to clean streets was something new
			and surprising to them.
		</p>
		<p>
			Who was this governor of whom the Prophet's grandson, al-Hasan,
			may God be pleased with him said: "There was no rider who came to
			Basrah who was better for its people than he."
		</p>
		<p>
			His real name was Abdullah ibn Qays but he was and continues to
			be known as Abu Musa al-Ashari. He left his native land, the
			Yemen, for Makkah immediately after hearing that a Prophet had
			appeared there who was a man of rare insight, who called people
			to the worship of One God and who insisted on the highest
			standards of morality.
		</p>
		<p>
			At Makkah, he stayed in the company of the Prophet and gained
			knowledge and guidance. He returned to his country to propagate
			the word of God and spread the mission of the noble Prophet,
			peace be on him. We have no further news of him for more than a
			decade. Then just after the end of the Khaybar expedition he came
			to the Prophet in Madinah.  His arrival there coincided with that
			of Jaffar ibn Abi Talib and other Muslims from Abyssinia and the
			Prophet welcomed them all with joy and happiness.
		</p>
		<p>
			This time Abu Musa did not come alone. He came with more than
			fifty persons from the Yemen all of whom had accepted Islam. 
			Among them were his two brothers, Abu Ruhm and Abu Burdah.  The
			Prophet referred to the whole group as the "Asharis". In fact he
			sometimes referred to all Yemenis as Asharis after Abu Musa
			al-Ashari.  He often praised the group for their soft and
			tender-hearted nature and held them up to the rest of his
			companions as a high example of good behavior. He once said of
			them:
		</p>
		<p>
			"If the Asharis go on an expedition or if they only have a little
			food among them, they would gather all they have on one cloth and
			divide it equally among themselves.  They are thus from me and I
			am from them."
		</p>
		<p>
			Abu Musa soon became highly esteemed in the Muslim community.  He
			had many great qualities.  He was a faqih endowed with
			intelligence and sound judgement and was ranked as one of the
			leading judges in the early Muslim community. People used to say:
			"The judges in this ummah are four: Umar, Ali, Abu Musa and Zayd
			ibn Thabit."
		</p>
		<p>
			Abu Musa had a natural, uncomplicated disposition. He was by
			nature a trusting person and expected people to deal with him on
			the basis of trust and sincerity.
		</p>
		<p>
			In the field of jihad, he was a warrior of great courage
		</p>
		<p>
			and endurance and skill. The Prophet said of him: "The master of
			horsemen is Abu Musa."
		</p>
		<p>
			"Abu Musa's insight and the soundness of his judgment did not
			allow him to be deceived by an enemy in battle. In battle
			conditions he saw situations with complete clarity and executed
			his actions with a firm resolve.
		</p>
		<p>
			Abu Musa was in command of the Muslim army traversing the lands
			of the Sasanian Empire. At Isfahan, the people came to him and
			offered to pay the jizyah (in return for military protection) to
			make peace and avoid fighting. However. they were not sincere in
			their offer and merely wanted an opportunity to mount a
			treacherous attack on the Muslims. Abu Musa however saw through
			their real intentions and he remained on the alert. Thus when the
			Isfahanis launched their attack, the Muslim leader was not caught
			off-guard, He engaged them in battle and before midday of the
			following day, he had won a decisive victory.
		</p>
		<p>
			In the major campaigns against the powerful Sasanian Empire Abu
			Musa's role was outstanding. In the great Battle of Tustar
			itself, he distinguished himself as a military commander.
		</p>
		<p>
			The Persian commander, Hormuzan, had withdrawn his numerous
			forces to the strongly fortified city of Tustar.  The Caliph Umar
			did not underestimate the strength of the enemy and he mobilized
			powerful and numerous force to confront Hormuzan.  Among the
			Muslim forces were dedicated veterans like Ammar ibn Yasir,
			al-Baraa ibn Malik and his brother Anas, Majra'a al-Bakri and
			Salamah ibn Rajaa. Umar appointed Abu Musa as commander of the
			army.
		</p>
		<p>
			So well fortified was Tustar that it was impossible to take it by
			storm. Several attempts were made to breach the walls but these
			proved unsuccessful. There followed a long and difficult siege
			which became even more testing and agonizing for the Muslims
			when, as we saw in the story of al-Baraa ibn Malik, the Persians
			began throwing down iron chains from the walls of the fortress at
			the ends of which were fastened red-hot iron hooks. Muslims were
			caught by these hooks and were pulled up either dead or in the
			agony of death.
		</p>
		<p>
			Abu Musa realized that the increasingly unbearable impasse could
			only be broken by a resort to stratagem. Fortunately, at this
			time a Persian defected to the Muslim side and Abu Musa induced
			him to return behind the walls of the fortified city and use
			whatever artful means he could to open the city's gates from
			within. With the Persian he sent a  special force of hand-picked
			men. They succeeded well in their task, opened the gates and made
			way for Abu Musa's army.  Within hours the Persians were subdued.
		</p>
		<p>
			In spite of the fact that Abu Musa was a strong and powerful
			warrior, he often left the battlefield transformed into a
			penitent, weeping person. At such times, he would read the Quran
			in a voice that profoundly stirred the souls of all who listened
			to him. Concerning his moving and melodious recitation of the
			Quran the Prophet, peace be on him, had said: "Abu Musa has
			indeed been given one of the flutes of the people of David."
		</p>
		<p>
			Also, Umar, may god be pleased with him, often summoned Abu Musa
			and asked him to recite from the Book of God, saying:
		</p>
		<p>
			"Create in us a yearning for our Lord, O Abu Musa." As a mark of
			his dedication to the Quran, Abu Musa was one of the few
			companions who had prepared a mushaf  a written collection of the
			revelations.
		</p>
		<p>
			Abu Musa only participated in fighting against the armies of
			Mushrikin, armies which tried to oppose the religion of God and
			extinguish the light of faith. When fighting broke out among
			Muslims, he fled from such conflict anti never look any part in
			it. Such was his stand	in  the conflict that arose between Ali
			and Muawiyah. It is in relation to this conflict and in
			particular his role as an adjudicator that the name of Abu Musa
			al-Ashari is most widely known.
		</p>
		<p>
			Briefly, Abu Musa's position appeared to be that of a 'neutral.'
			He saw Muslims killing each other and felt that if the situation
			were to continue the very future of the Muslim ummah would be
			threatened. To start off with a clean slate. the Khalifah Ali
			should give up the position and Muawiyah should relinquish any
			claim to be Khalifah and the Muslims should be given a free
			choice to elect whoever they wanted as Khalifah.
		</p>
		<p>
			It was of course true that Imam Ali held the position of Khalifah
			legitimately and that any unlawful revolt could only have as its
			object the challenging and overturning of the rule of law.
			However, developments had gone so far, the dispute had become so
			bloody and there seemed to be no end in sight except further
			bloodshed, that a new approach to a solution seemed the only hope
			of avoiding further bloodshed and continuous civil war.
		</p>
		<p>
			When Imam Ali accepted the principle of arbitration, he wanted
			Abdullah ibn Abbas to represent him. But an influential section
			of his followers insisted on Abu Musa. Their reason for so doing
			was that Abu Musa had not taken part in the dispute from its
			beginning.  Instead he had kept aloof from both parties when he
			despaired of bringing about an understanding and a reconciliation
			and putting an end to the fighting. Therefore, they felt, he was
			the most suitable person to be the arbitrator.
		</p>
		<p>
			Imam Ali had no reason to doubt the devotion of Abu Musa to Islam
			and his truthfulness and sincerity. But he knew the shrewdness of
			the other side and their likely resort to ruses and treachery. He
			also knew that Abu Musa in spite of his understanding and his
			knowledge despised deceit and conspiracies and always wanted to
			deal with people on the basis of trust and honesty, not through
			cunning.  Ali therefore feared that Abu Musa would be deceived by
			others and that arbitration would end up with the victory of
			guile over honesty and that the situation would end up being more
			perilous than it was.
		</p>
		<p>
			Adjudication nonetheless began with Abu Musa representing the
			side of Ali and Amr ibn al-Aas representing the side of Muawiyah.
			A possible version of their historic conversation has been
			recorded in the book "Al-Akhbar at-Tiwal" by Abu Hanifah
			Ad-Daynawawi as follows:
		</p>
		<p>
			Abu Musa:	O Amr, what do you think of this suggestion in
			which there is the common good of the ummah and the pleasure of
			Allah?
		</p>
		<p>
			Amr:	What is it?
		</p>
		<p>
			Abu Musa:	Let us nominate Abdullah ibn Umar as Khalifah. 
			He himself has not intervened at all in this war.
		</p>
		<p>
			Amr:	What do you think of Muawiyah for the position?
		</p>
		<p>
			Abu Musa:	It is neither opportune to have Muawiyah in this
			position nor does he deserve it.
		</p>
		<p>
			Amr:	Don't you know that Uthman was unjustly murdered?
		</p>
		<p>
			Abu Musa:	Certainly.
		</p>
		<p>
			Amr:	And that his status among the Quraysh you know (is one of
			honor), and that Muawiyah is the wali of the blood of Uthman....
			And God says in the Quran: "Whoever is killed unjustly, We have
			given his heir authority...." (The full verse of the Quran is:
			Nor take life which God has made sacred except for a just cause.
			And if anyone is slain wrongfully, We have given his heir
			authority (to demand Qisas or to forgive). But let him not exceed
			bounds in the matter of taking life; for he is helped by the Law.
			Surah 17, verse 33 .) In addition to this he is the brother of
			Umm Habibah, the wife of the Prophet, may God bless him and grant
			him peace, and he is one of his companions.
		</p>
		<p>
			Abu Musa:	Fear God, O Amr..  Regarding what you have
			mentioned about the status of Muawiyah, if the position of the
			Khalifah is based on status, the person most deserving of it is
			"Abrahah ibn Sabbah". He is a descendant of Yemeni kings whose
			domain extended to the east and the west. And what status has
			Muawiyah in comparison with Ali ibn Abi Talib? Regarding your
			statement that Muawiyah is the wali of Uthman, the person who has
			the first right to this is his son, Amr ibn Uthman. However, if
			you agree with me, we could revert to the memory of Umar ibn
			al-Khattab and appoint his son Abdullah, the pious one.
		</p>
		<p>
			Amr:	What prevents you from appointing my son Abdullah   he is
			virtuous, upright, one of those who were first to perform the
			Hijrah and who has been a long-standing companion of the Prophet.
		</p>
		<p>
			Abu Musa:	Your son is a man of honesty and truth. But you
			have plunged him deeply into these wars. Come let us appoint the
			Good One, the son of the Good One - Abdullah ibn Umar.
		</p>
		<p>
			Amr:	O Abu Musa! The only person who can set this matter
			aright is a man who has two wisdom teeth who eats with one and
			feeds with the other (referring to the political astuteness of
			Muawiyah).
		</p>
		<p>
			Abu Musa:	Woe to you, O Amr. The Muslims are depending on
			us to solve this matter. They have fought with swords and spears.
			Let us not return them to a state of fitnah.
		</p>
		<p>
			Amr:	What are you suggesting then?
		</p>
		<p>
			Abu Musa:	I suggest that we leave the two men-Ali and
			Muawiyah.  Then we set up a shura among Muslims to let them
			choose from among themselves whoever they like.
		</p>
		<p>
			Amr:	I agree to this suggestion for indeed the common good of
			the people rests in it.
		</p>
		<p>
			The above exchange shows Abu Musa to be a man of integrity and
			intelligence. He showed up the weakness of Amr's claims for
			Muawiyah to be the Caliph of the Muslims on the grounds of honor
			and status and on the grounds that he was the 'heir' to Uthman.
		</p>
		<p>
			By his suggestion that the son of Umar ibn al-Khattab be
			appointed as Khalifah, Abu Musa showed that he was not prepared
			to stick uncompromisingly to the side he represented and that he
			was willing to consider an appropriate companion of the Prophet
			as an alternative, for the good of the Muslim community.
		</p>
		<p>
			Amr finally agreed on Abu Musa's suggestion for a shura and for
			letting the Muslims decide freely whom they should have as
			Khalifah. It did not occur to Abu Musa that Amr would not honor
			the agreement they had come to and that he would resort to
			deceit.
		</p>
		<p>
			Before the agreement was announced in public, Ibn Abbas warned
			Abu Musa saying: "I fear, by God, that Amr might deceive you. If
			you have both agreed on something, then let him announce it
			before you.."
		</p>
		<p>
			Abu Musa, because of the gravity of the situation, felt that Amr
			would honor the agreement. On the following day, before the
			assembled Muslims, Abu Musa and Amr got together. Abu Musa is
			said to have invited Amr to speak first but he declined saying:
		</p>
		<p>
			"I would not go before you for you are more honoured than I am,
			you performed the Hijrah before I did and you are older than I."
			With this Abu Musa advanced and spoke:
		</p>
		<p>
			"O people! We have considered how best God would. bring together
			the Ummah for their common good. It seems to us that the best
			solution in this regard is that the two men   Ali and Muawiyah	
			should withdraw and that a shura should be formed so that people
			could choose for themselves who they want as the Khalifah.
		</p>
		<p>
			"I have agreed that Ali and Muawiyah should withdraw." "You now
			deal with the situation and appoint as you Khalifah whoever you
			want."
		</p>
		<p>
			It was now Amr's turn to make the same announcement. He got up
			and addressed the people: "O People! Abu Musa has said what you
			have heard. He has abandoned his friend (Ali). Like him I abandon
			his friend (Ali) and I confirm my friend Muawiyah (as Khalifah)
			for he is the heir to the Amir al-Muminin, Uthman, and the one
			most deserves his position."
		</p>
		<p>
			Abu Musa was shocked by what he heard. He could not imagine that
			Amr would commit such treachery even though he was warned about
			it. Filled with anger and disgust, he lambasted Amr for his
			deceit and for ruining the chances of peace and reconciliation
			among Muslims.	Amr had thus turned the arbitration process into
			a farce.
		</p>
		<p>
			Abu Musa continued to remain neutral in the conflict which was
			ended by Ali when he made a treaty with Muawiyah confirming him
			as the one responsible for governing Syria and Egypt.
		</p>
		<p>
			Abu Musa himself left for Makkah and spent the rest of his life
			near the Sacred Mosque. During his life he had remained devoted
			to the noble Prophet and his righteous successors. During the
			life of the Prophet, the Prophet had appointed him and Muadh ibn
			Jabal as governor of Kufah.
		</p>
		<p>
			Abu Musa was particularly attached to the Quran, reading it
			constantly, memorizing it, understanding it and putting it into
			practice.  His advice regarding the Quran is full of wisdom:
			"Follow the Quran," he said, "and do not desire that the Quran
			should follow you."
		</p>
		<p>
			In ibadah, he showed a great deal of strength and endurance.  On
			days when the heat was intense and almost unbearable, Abu Musa
			would be found fasting and he would say: "Perhaps the thirst of
			the midday heat would prove to be quenching for us on the day of
			Qiyamah."
		</p>
		<p>
			As his end drew near, the words which he kept saying were words
			which he was wont to repeat throughout his life as a believer:
		</p>
		<p>
			"Allahumma anta-s Salaam Wa minka-s Salaam. "O Lord, You are the
			Source of Peace And from You comes Peace..."

	<biography name="Sad ibn Abi Waqqas">
		<p>
			We are now in a small town in a narrow valley. There is no
			vegetation, no livestock, no gardens, no rivers. Desert after
			desert separates the town from the rest of the world.	During
			the day the heat of the sun is unbearable and the nights are
			still and lonely. Tribes flock to it like animals in the open
			country flock to a water-hole. No government rules.  There is no
			religion to guide people except one which promotes the worship of
			stone idols. There is no knowledge except priestcraft and a love
			for elegant poetry. This is Makkah and these are the Arabs.
		</p>
		<p>
			In this town lies a young man who has not yet seen twenty
			summers.  He is short and well-built and has a very heavy crop of
			hair. People compare him to a young lion. He comes from a rich
			and noble family. He is very attached to his parents and is
			particularly fond of his mother. He spends much of his time
			making and repairing bows and arrows and practising archery as if
			preparing himself for some great encounter.  People recognize him
			as a serious and intelligent young man. He finds no satisfaction
			in the religion and way of life of his people, their corrupt
			beliefs and disagreeable practices. His name is Sad ibn Abi
			Waqqas.
		</p>
		<p>
			One morning at about this time in his life the genial Abu Bakr
			came up and spoke softly to him. He explained that Muhammad ibn
			Abdullah the son of his late cousin Aminah bint Wahb had been
			given Revelations and sent with the religion of guidance and
			truth. Abu Bakr then took him to Muhammad in one of the valleys
			of Makkah. It was late afternoon by this time and the Prophet had
			just prayed Salat al-Asr. Sad was excited and overwhelmed and
			responded readily to the invitation to truth and the religion of
			One God. The fact that he was one of the first persons to accept
			Islam was something that pleased him greatly.
		</p>
		<p>
			The Prophet, peace be on him, was also greatly pleased when Sad
			became a Muslim. He saw in him signs of excellence. The fact that
			he was still in his youth promised great things to come. It was
			as if this glowing crescent would become a shining full moon
			before long. Perhaps other young people of Makkah would follow
			his example, including some of his relations. For Sad ibn Abi
			Waqqas was in fact a maternal uncle of the Prophet since he
			belonged to the Bani Zuhrah, the clan of Aminah bint Wahb, the
			mother of the Prophet, peace be upon him. For this reason he is
			sometimes referred to as Sad of Zuhrah, to distinguish him from
			several others whose first name was Sad.
		</p>
		<p>
			The Prophet is reported to have been pleased with his family
			relationship to Sad. Once as he was sitting with his companions,
			he saw Sad approaching and he said to them: "This is my maternal
			uncle. Let a man see his maternal uncle!"
		</p>
		<p>
			While the Prophet was delighted with Sad's acceptance of Islam,
			others	  including and especially his mother  were not. Sad
			relates: "When my mother heard the news of my Islam, she flew
			into a rage. She came up to me and said:
		</p>
		<p>
			"O Sad! What is this religion that you have embraced which has
			taken you away from the religion of your mother and father...? By
			God, either you forsake your new religion or I would not eat or
			drink until I die. Your heart would be broken with grief for me
			and remorse would consume you on account of the deed which you
			have done and people would censure you forever more.'
		</p>
		<p>
			'Don't do (such a thing), my mother,' I said, 'for I would not
			give up my religion for anything.'
		</p>
		<p>
			However, she went on with her threat... For days she neither ate
			nor drank. She became emaciated and weak. Hour after hour, I went
			to her asking whether I should bring her some food or something
			to drink but she persistently refused, insisting that she would
			neither eat nor drink until she died or I abandoned my religion.
			I said to her:
		</p>
		<p>
			'Yaa Ummaah! In spite of my strong love for you, my love for God
			and His Messenger is indeed stronger. By God, if you had a
			thousand souls and one soul after another were to depart, I would
			not abandon this my religion for anything.' When she saw that I
			was determined she relented unwillingly and ate and drank."
		</p>
		<p>
			It was concerning Sad's relationship with his mother and her
			attempt to force him to recant his faith that the words of the
			Quran were revealed: "And we enjoined on man (to be good) to his
			parents. In pain upon pain did his mother bear him and his
			weaning took two years. So show gratitude to Me and to your
			parents. To Me is the final destiny.
		</p>
		<p>
			"But if they strive to make you join in worship with Me things of
			which you have no knowledge, obey them not. Yet bear them company
			in this life with justice and consideration and follow the way of
			those who turn to Me. In the end, the return of you all is to Me
			and I shall tell you (the truth and meaning of) all that you used
			to do." (Surah Luqman, 31: 14-15).
		</p>
		<p>
			In these early days of Islam, the Muslims were careful not to
			arouse the sensibilities of the Quraysh. They would often go out
			together in groups to the glens outside Makkah where they could
			pray together without being seen. But one day a number of
			idolaters came upon them while they were praying and rudely
			interrupted them with ridicule. The Muslims felt they could not
			suffer these indignities passively and they came to blows with
			the idolaters. Sad ibn Abi Waqqas struck one of the disbelievers
			with the jawbone of a camel and wounded him. This was the first
			blood shed in the conflict between Islam and kufr  - a conflict
			that was later to escalate and test the patience and courage of
			the Muslims.
		</p>
		<p>
			After the incident, however, the Prophet enjoined his companions
			to be patient and forbearing for this was the command of God:
			"And bear with patience what they say and avoid them with noble
			dignity. And leave Me alone to deal with those who give the lie
			to the Truth, those who enjoy the blessings of life (without any
			thought of God) and bear with them for a little while." (The
			Quran, Surah al Muzzammil, 71: 1O).
		</p>
		<p>
			More than a decade later when permission was given for the
			Muslims to fight. Sad ibn Abi Waqqas was to play a distinguished
			role in many of the engagements that took place both during the
			time of the Prophet and after. He fought at Badr together with
			his young brother Umayr who had cried to be allowed to accompany
			the Muslim army for he was only in his early teens. Sad returned
			to Madinah alone for Umayr was one of the fourteen Muslim martyrs
			who fell in the battle.
		</p>
		<p>
			At the Battle of Uhud, Sad was specially chosen as one of the
			best archers together with Zayd, Saib the son of Uthman ibn Mazun
			and others. Sad was one of those who fought   vigorously in
			defence of the Prophet after some Muslims had deserted their
			positions. To urge him on, the Prophet, peace be on him, said:
			"Irmi Sad...Fidaaka Abi wa Ummi "   Shoot, Sad ...may my mother
			and father be your ransom."
		</p>
		<p>
			Of this occasion, Ali ibn Abi Talib said that he had not yet
			heard the Prophet, peace be on him, promising such a ransom to
			anyone except Sad. Sad is also known as the first companion to
			have shot an arrow in defence of Islam. And the Prophet once
			prayed for him:
		</p>
		<p>
			"O Lord, direct his shooting and respond to his prayer." Sad was
			one of the companions of the Prophet who was blessed with great
			wealth. Just as he was known for his bravery, so he was known for
			his generosity. During the Farewell Pilgrimage with the Prophet,
			he fell ill. The Prophet came to visit him and Sad said:
		</p>
		<p>
			"O Messenger of God. I have wealth and I only have one daughter
			to inherit from me. Shall I give two thirds of my wealth as
			sadaqah?" "No," replied the Prophet. "Then, (shall I give) a
			half?." asked Sad and the Prophet again said 'no'.
		</p>
		<p>
			"Then, (shall I give) a third?' asked Sad.
		</p>
		<p>
			"Yes," said the Prophet. "The third is much. Indeed to leave your
			heirs well-off' is better than that you should leave them
			dependent on and to beg from people. If you spend anything
			seeking to gain thereby the pleasure of God, you will be rewarded
			for it even if it is a morsel which you place in your wife's
			mouth."
		</p>
		<p>
			Sad did not remain the father of just one child but was blessed
			thereafter with many children.
		</p>
		<p>
			Sad is mainly renowned as the commander-in-chief of the strong
			Muslim army which Umar despatched to confront the Persians at
			Qadisiyyah. Umar wanted nothing less than an end to Sasanian
			power which for centuries had dominated the region.
		</p>
		<p>
			To confront the numerous and well-equipped Persians was a most
			daunting task. The most powerful force had to be mustered. Umar
			sent despatches to Muslim governors throughout the state to
			mobilize all able-bodied persons who had weapons or mounts, or
			who had talents of oratory and other skills to place at the
			service of the battle.
		</p>
		<p>
			Bands of Mujahidin then converged on Madinah from every part of
			the Muslim domain. When they had all gathered, Umar consulted the
			leading Muslims about the appointment of a commander-in-chief
			over the mighty army. Umar himself thought of leading the army
			but Ali suggested that the Muslims were in great need of him and
			he should not endanger his life. Sad was then chosen as commander
			and Abdur-Rahman ibn Awl, one of the veterans among the Sahabah
			said:
		</p>
		<p>
			"You have chosen well! Who is there like Sad?" Umar stood before
			the great army and bade farewell to them. To the
			commander-in-chief he said:
		</p>
		<p>
			"O Sad! Let not any statement that you are the uncle of the
			Messenger of God or that you are the companion of the Messenger
			of God distract you from God. God Almighty does not obliterate
			evil with evil but he wipes out evil with good.
		</p>
		<p>
			"O Sad! There is no connection between God and anyone except
			obedience to Him. In the sight of God all people whether nobleman
			or commoner are the same. Allah is their Lord and they are His
			servants seeking elevation through taqwa and seeking to obtain
			what is with God through obedience. Consider how the Messenger of
			God used to act with the Muslims and act accordingly..."
		</p>
		<p>
			Umar thus made it clear that the army was not to seek conquest
			for the sake of it and that the expedition was not for seeking
			personal glory and fame.
		</p>
		<p>
			The three thousand strong army set off. Among them were ninety
			nine veterans of Badr, more than three	 hundred of those who
			took the Pledge of Riffwan (Satisfaction) at Hudaybiyyah and
			three hundred of those who had participated in the liberation of
			Makkah with the noble Prophet. There were seven hundred sons of
			the companions. Thousands of women also went on to battle as
			auxiliaries and nurses and to urge the men on to battle.
		</p>
		<p>
			The army camped at Qadisiyyah near Hira. Against them the
			Persians had mobilized a force of 12O,OOO men under the
			leadership of their most brilliant commander, Rustum.
		</p>
		<p>
			Umar had instructed Sad to send him regular despatches about the
			condition and movements of the Muslim forces, and of the
			deployment of the enemy's forces. Sad wrote to Umar about the
			unprecedented force that the Persians were mobilizing and Umar
			wrote to him:
		</p>
		<p>
			"Do not be troubled by what you hear about them nor about the
			(forces, equipment and methods) they would deploy against you.
			Seek help with God and put your trust in Him and send men of
			insight, knowledge and toughness to him (the Chosroes) to invite
			him to God... And write to me daily."
		</p>
		<p>
			Sad understood well the gravity of the impending battle and kept
			in close contact with the military high command in Madinah.
			Although commander-in-chief, he understood the importance of
			shura.
		</p>
		<p>
			Sad did as Umar instructed and sent delegations of Muslims first
			to Yazdagird and then to Rustum, inviting them to accept Islam or
			to pay the jizyah to guarantee their protection and peaceful
			existence or to choose war if they so desired.
		</p>
		<p>
			The first Muslim delegation which included Numan ibn Muqarrin was
			ridiculed by the Persian Emperor, Yazdagird.  Sad sent a
			delegation to Rustum, the commander of the Persian forces. This
			was led by Rubiy ibn Aamir who, with spear in hand, went directly
			to Rustam's encampment. Rustam said to him:
		</p>
		<p>
			"Rubiy! What do you want from us? If you want wealth we would
			give you. We would provide you with provisions until you are
			sated. We would clothe you. We would make you become rich  and
			happy. Look, Rubiy! What do you see in this assembly of mine? No
			doubt you see signs of richness and luxury, these lush carpets,
			fine curtains, gold embroidered wails, carpets of silk...Do you
			have any desire that we should bestow some of these riches which
			we have on you?"
		</p>
		<p>
			Rustum thus wanted to impress the Muslim and allure him from his
			purpose by this show of opulence and grandeur. Rubiy looked and
			listened unmoved and then said:
		</p>
		<p>
			"Listen, O commander! Certainly God has chosen us that through us
			those of His creation whom He so desires could be drawn away from
			the worship of idols to Tawhid (the affirmation of the unity of
			God), from the narrow confines of preoccupation with this world
			to its boundless expanse and from the tyranny of rulers to
			justice of Islam.
		</p>
		<p>
			"Whoever accepts that from us we are prepared to welcome him. And
			whoever fights us, we would fight him until the promise of God
			comes to pass." "And what is the promise of God to you?" asked
			Rustum. "Paradise for our martyrs and victory for those who
			live."
		</p>
		<p>
			Rustum of course was not inclined to listen to such talk from a
			seemingly wretched person the likes of whom the Persians regarded
			as barbaric and uncivilized and whom they had conquered and
			subjugated for centuries.
		</p>
		<p>
			The Muslim delegation returned to their commanderin-chief. It was
			clear that war was now inevitable. Sad's eyes filled with tears.
			He wished that the battle could be delayed a little or indeed
			that it might have been somewhat earlier. For on this particular
			day he was seriously ill and could hardly move. He was suffering
			from sciatica and he could not even sit upright for the pain.
		</p>
		<p>
			Sad knew that this was going to be a bitter, harsh and bloody
			battle. And for a brief moment he thought, if only... but no! 
			The Messenger of God had taught the Muslims that none of them
			should say, "If....." To say "If....." implied a lack of will and
			determination and wishing that a situation might have been
			different was not the characteristic of a firm believer. So,
			despite his illness, Sad got up and stood before his army and
			addressed them. He began his speech with a verse from the
			glorious Quran:
		</p>
		<p>
			"And indeed after having exhorted (man), We have laid it down in
			all the books of Divine wisdom that My righteous servants shall
			inherit the earth." Surah al-Anbiyaa, 21:1O5).
		</p>
		<p>
			The address over, Sad performed Salat az-Zuhr with the army.
			Facing them once again, he shouted the Muslim battle cry "Allahu
			Akbar" four times and directed the fighters to attack with the
			words:
		</p>
		<p>
			"Hayya ala barakatillah   Charge, with the blessings of God."
			Standing in front of his tent, Sad directed his soldiers and
			spurred them on with shouts of Allahu Akbar (God is Most Great)
			and La hawla wa la quwwata ilia billah (there is no power or
			might save with God). For four days the battle raged. The Muslims
			displayed valor and skill. But a Persian elephant corps wrought
			havoc in the ranks of the Muslims. The ferocious battle was only
			resolved when several renowned Muslim warriors made a rush in the
			direction of the Persian commander. A storm arose and the canopy
			of Rustam was blown into the river. As he tried to flee he was
			detected and slain. Complete confusion reigned among the Persians
			and they fled in disarray.
		</p>
		<p>
			Just how ferocious the battle was can be imagined when it is
			known that some thirty thousand persons on both sides fell in the
			course of four days' fighting. In one day alone, some two
			thousand Muslims and about ten thousand Persians lost their
			lives.
		</p>
		<p>
			The Battle of Qadisiyyah is one of the major decisive battles of
			world history. It sealed the fate of the Sasanian Empire just as
			the Battle of Yarmuk had sealed the fate of the Byzantine Empire
			in the east.
		</p>
		<p>
			Two years after Qadisiyyah, Sad went on to take the Sasanian
			capital. By then he had recovered his health. The taking of
			Ctesiphon was accomplished after a brilliant  crossing of the
			Tigris river while it was in flood. Sad has thus gone down in the
			annals of history as the Hero of Qadisiyyah and the Conqueror of
			Ctesiphon.
		</p>
		<p>
			He lived until he was almost eighty years old. He was blessed
			with much influence and wealth but as the time of death
			approached in the year 54 AH, he asked his son to open a box in
			which he had kept a course woolen jubbah and said: "Shroud me in
			this, for in this (jubbah) I met the Mushrikin on the day of Badr
			and in it I desire to meet God Almighty."

	<biography name="An-Nuayman ibn Amr">
		<p>
			In spite of the fact that he fought in the battles of Badr, Uhud,
			Khandaq and other major encounters, an-Nuayman remained a
			light-hearted person who was quick at repartee and who loved to
			play practical jokes on others.
		</p>
		<p>
			He belonged to the Banu an-Najjar of Madinah and he was among the
			early Muslims of the city. He was one of those who pledged
			allegiance to the Prophet at the Second Pledge of Aqabah. He
			established links with the Quraysh when he married the sister of
			Abdur Rahman ibn Awl and later Umm Kulthum the daughter of Uqbah
			ibn Mu'ayt.  She had obtained a divorce from her husband
			az-Zubayr ibn al-Awwam on account of his harshness and severity.
		</p>
		<p>
			Unfortunately for a time an-Nuayman became addicted to alcohol. 
			He was caught drinking and the Prophet had him flogged. He was
			caught a second time and then he had him flogged again. Because
			he still did not give up the habit, the Prophet ordered that he
			be flogged with shoes. When all this did not persuade him to stop
			drinking, the Prophet finally said:  "If he goes back (to
			drinking) then kill him."
		</p>
		<p>
			This was a severe Pronouncement and Umayr, one of the companions
			of the Prophet, understood from it that should he return to the
			drinking of alcohol, an-Nuayman would go outside the pale of
			Islam and deserve death. Umayr gave vent to his anger  and
			disgust by saying: "La 'nat Allah alayhi - may God's curse be on
			him."
		</p>
		<p>
			The Prophet heard Umayr's imprecation and said: "No, no, don't do
			(such a thing).  Indeed he loves God and His Apostle. The major
			sin (as this) does not put one outside the community and the
			mercy of God is close to the believers."
		</p>
		<p>
			While being firm, the Prophet still held out hope for
			an-Nuayman's reform especially on account of his past sacrifices
			as a veteran of Badr. Because he was not someone who went out of
			his way to conceal his actions, it was easier for him to
			acknowledge his crimes and repent and seek forgiveness from God.
			This he did and he won the favor of the Prophet and his
			companions who enjoyed his pleasantries and his infectious
			laughter.
		</p>
		<p>
			Once an-Nuayman went to the suq and saw some food being sold
			which appeared to be tasty and delightful. He ordered some and
			sent it to the Prophet as if it were a gift from him. The Prophet
			was delighted with the food and he and his family ate of it. The
			vendor of the food then came to an-Nuayman to collect the price
			of it and an-Nuayman said to him: "Go to the Messenger of God it
			was for him. He and his family ate it."
		</p>
		<p>
			The vendor went to the Prophet who in turn asked an-Nuayman:
			"Didn't you give it to me?" "Yes," said an-Nuayman. "I thought
			you would like it and I wanted you to eat some of it so I had it
			presented to you. But I don't have any dirhams to pay the vendor
			for it. So, pay, O Messenger of God!"
		</p>
		<p>
			The Prophet had a good laugh and so did his companions. The laugh
			was at his expense, literally, for he had  to  pay  the  price 
			of  the  unsolicited  gift. An-Nuayman felt that two benefits
			came out of the incident: the Prophet and his family ate food
			that they enjoyed and the Muslims had a good laugh.
		</p>
		<p>
			Once Abu Bakr and some companions went on a trading expedition to
			Busra.	Various people on the trip were given fixed duties. 
			Suwaybit ibn Harmalah was made responsible for food and
			provisions. An-Nuayman was one of the group and on the way he
			became hungry and asked Suwaybit for some food. Suwaybit refused
			and an-Nuayman said to him:
		</p>
		<p>
			"Do you know what I would yet do with you?" and went on to warn
			and threaten him but still Suwaybit refused. An-Nuayman then went
			to a group of Arabs in the suq and said to them: "Would you like
			to have a strong and sturdy slave whom I can sell to you." They
			said yes and an-Nuayman went on: "He has got a ready tongue and
			is very articulate. He would resist you and say: 'I am free.' But
			don't listen
		</p>
		<p>
			to him"
		</p>
		<p>
			The men paid the price of the slave - ten qala'is (pieces of
			gold) and an-Nuayman accepted it and appeared to complete the
			transaction with business-like efficiency. The buyers accompanied
			him to fetch theft purchase. Pointing to Suwaybit, he said: "This
			is the slave whom I sold to you."
		</p>
		<p>
			The men took hold of Suwaybit and he shouted for dear life and
			freedom. "I am free. I am Suwaybit ibn Harmalah..."
		</p>
		<p>
			But they paid no attention to him and dragged him off by the neck
			as they would have done with any slave.
		</p>
		<p>
			All the while, an-Nuayman did not laugh or batter an eyelid. He
			remained completely calm and serious while Suwaybit continued to
			protest bitterly.  Suwaybit's fellow travellers, realizing what
			was happening, rushed to fetch Abu Bakr, the leader of the
			caravan, who came running as fast as he could.	He explained to
			the purchasers what had happened and so they released Suwaybit
			and had their money returned. Abu Bakr then laughed heartily and
			so did Suwaybit and an-Nuayman. Back in Madinah, when the episode
			was recounted to the Prophet and his companions, they all laughed
			even more.
		</p>
		<p>
			A man once came to the Prophet on a delegation and tethered his
			camel at the door of the Masjid.  The Sahabah noticed that the
			camel had a large fat hump and their appetite for succulent tasty
			meat was stimulated. They turned to Nuayman and asked: "Would you
			deal with this camel?"
		</p>
		<p>
			An-Nuayman understood what they meant. He got up and slaughtered
			the camel. The nomad Arab came out and realized what had happened
			when he saw people grilling, sharing out and eating meat. He
			shouted in distress: "Waa 'aqraah! Waa Naqataah! (O my camel!)"
		</p>
		<p>
			The Prophet heard the commotion and came out. He learnt from the
			Sahabah what had happened and began searching for an-Nuayman but
			did not find him. Afraid of being blamed and punished, an-Nuayman
			had fled. The Prophet then followed his footprints. These led to
			a garden  belonging to	Danbaah the daughter of az-Zubayr, a
			cousin of the Prophet.	He asked the companions where an-Nuayman
			was.  Pointing to a nearby ditch, they said loudly so as not to
			alert an-Nuayman: "We haven't found him, O Messenger of God."
			An-Nuayman was found in the ditch covered with palm branches and
			leaves and emerged with dirt on his head, beard and face. He
			stood in the presence of the Prophet who took him by the head and
			dusted the dirt from his face while he chuckled with laughter. 
			The companions joined in the mirth. The Prophet paid the price of
			the camel to its owner and they all joined in the feast.
		</p>
		<p>
			The  Prophet  obviously  regarded  an-Nuayman's pranks for what
			they were light-hearted sallies that were meant to create some
			relief and laughter.  The religion of Islam does not require
			people to disdain seemly laughter and levity and remain
			perpetually gloomy.  An appropriate sense of humor is often a
			saving grace.
		</p>
		<p>
			An-Nuayman lived on after the Prophet and continued to enjoy the
			affection of Muslims. But did he put an end to his laughter?
			During the caliphate of Uthman, a group of Sahabah were sitting
			in the Masjid.	They saw Makhramah ibn Nawfal, an old man who was
			about one hundred and fifteen years old and obviously rather
			senile.  He was related to the sister of Abdur-Rahman ibn Awl,
			who was a wife of an-Nuayman.
		</p>
		<p>
			Makhramah was blind. He was so weak that he could hardly move
			from his place in the Masjid. He got up to urinate and might have
			done so in the Masjid. But the companions shouted at him to
			prevent him from doing so.. An-Nuayman got up and went to take
			him to another place, as he was instructed. What is this other
			place that an-Nuayman took him to? In fact he took him only a
			short distance away from where he was sitting at first and sat
			him down.
		</p>
		<p>
			The place was still in the Masjid!
		</p>
		<p>
			People shouted at Makhramah and made him get up again all in a
			frenzy. The poor old man was distressed and said: "Who has done
			this?" "An-Nuayman ibn Amr," he was told.
		</p>
		<p>
			The old man swore and announced that he would bash an-Nuayman on
			the head with his stick if he should meet him.
		</p>
		<p>
			An-Nuayman left and returned. He was up to some prank of his
			again. He saw Uthman ibn Allan, the Amir al-Muminim, performing
			Salat in the Masjid. Uthman was  never distracted  when  he stood
			 for Prayer. An-Nuayman also saw Makhramah. He went up to him and
			in a changed voice said: "Do you want to get at an-Nuayman?"
		</p>
		<p>
			The old man remembered what an-Nuayman had done. He remembered
			his vow and shouted: "Yes, where is he?" An-Nuayman took him by
			the hand and led him to the place where the Khalifah Uthman stood
			and said to him: "Here he is!"
		</p>
		<p>
			The old man raised his staff and bashed the head of
		</p>
		<p>
			Uthman. Blood flowed and the people shouted: "It's the Amir
			al-Muminin!"
		</p>
		<p>
			The dragged Makhramah away and some people set out to get
			an-Nuayman but Uthman restrained them and asked them to leave him
			alone.	In spite of the blows he had suffered, he was still able
			to laugh at the deeds of an-Nuayman.
		</p>
		<p>
			An-Nuayman lived up to the time of Muawiyah when fitnah saddened
			him and discord filled him with anguish. He lost his levity and
			laughed no more.
		</p>
	</biography>
	<biography name="Julaybib">
		<p>
			His name was unusual and incomplete.  Julaybib means "small
			grown" being the diminutive form of the word "Jalbab ".  The name
			is an indication that Julaybib was small and short, even of
			dwarf-like stature. More than that, he is described as being
			"damim" which means ugly, deformed, or of repulsive appearance.
		</p>
		<p>
			Even more disturbing, for the society in which he lived,
			Julaybib's lineage was not known.  There is no record of who his
			mother or his father was or to what tribe he belonged.	This was
			a grave disability in the society in which he lived.  Julaybib
			could not expect any compassion or help, any protection or
			support from a society that placed a great deal of importance on
			family and tribal connections.	In this regard, all that was
			known of him was that he was an Arab and that, as far as the new
			community of Islam was concerned, he was one of the Ansar. 
			Perhaps he belonged to one of the outlying tribes beyond Madinah
			and had drifted into the city or he could even have been from
			among the Ansar of the city itself.
		</p>
		<p>
			The disabilities under which Julaybib lived would have been
			enough to have him ridiculed and shunned in any society and in
			fact he was prohibited by one person, a certain Abu Barzah of the
			Aslam tribe, from entering his home. He once told his wife:
		</p>
		<p>
			"Do not let Julaybib enter among you. If he does, I shall
			certainly do (something terrible to him)." Probably because he
			was teased and scoffed at in the company of men, Julaybib used to
			take refuge in the company of women.
		</p>
		<p>
			Was there any hope of Julaybib being treated with respect and
			consideration? Was there any hope of his finding emotional
			satisfaction as an individual and as a man? Was there any hope of
			his enjoying the relationships which others take for granted? And
			in the new society emerging under the guidance of the Prophet,
			was he so insignificant as to be overlooked in the preoccupation
			with the great affairs of state and in the supreme issues of life
			and survival which constantly engaged the attention of the
			Prophet?
		</p>
		<p>
			Just as he was aware of the great issues of life and destiny, the
			Prophet of Mercy was also aware of the needs and sensibilities of
			his most humble companions. With Julaybib in mind, the Prophet
			went to one of the Ansar and said: "I want to have your daughter
			married." "How wonderful and blessed, O Messenger of God and what
			a delight to the eye (this would be)," replied the Ansari man
			with obvious joy and happiness. "I do not want her for myself,"
			added the Prophet. "Then for whom, O Messenger of God?" asked the
			man, obviously somewhat let down. "For Julaybib," said the
			Prophet.
		</p>
		<p>
			The Ansari must have been too shocked to give his own reaction
			and he merely said: "I will consult with her mother." And off he
			went to his wife. "The Messenger of God, may God bless him and
			grant him peace, wants to have your daughter married," he said to
			her. She too was thrilled. "What a wonderful idea and what a
			delight to the eye (this would be)." she said. "He doesn't want
			to marry her himself but he wants to marry her to Julaybib," he
			added. She was flabbergasted.
		</p>
		<p>
			"To Julaybib! No, never to Julaybib!  No, by the living God, we
			shall not marry (her) to him." she protested.
		</p>
		<p>
			As the Ansari was about to return to the Prophet to inform him of
			what his wife had said, the daughter who had heard her mother's
			protestations, asked: "Who has asked you to marry me?"
		</p>
		<p>
			Her mother told her of the Prophet's request for her hand in
			marriage to Julaybib. When she heard that the request had come
			from the Prophet and that her mother was absolutely opposed to
			the idea, she was greatly perturbed and said:
		</p>
		<p>
			"Do you refuse the request of the Messenger of God? Send me to
			him for he shall certainly not bring ruin to me." This was the
			reply of a truly great person who had a clear understanding of
			what was required of her as a Muslim. What greater satisfaction
			and fulfillment can a Muslim find than in responding willingly to
			the requests and commands of the Messenger of God!  No doubt,
			this companion of the Prophet, whose name we do not even know had
			heard the verse of the Quran: "Now whenever God and His Apostle
			have decided a matter, it is not for a believing man or believing
			woman to claim freedom of choice in so far as they themselves are
			concerned.  And he who disobeys God and His Prophet has already,
			most obviously, gone astray." (The Quran, Surah al-Ahzab, 33:36).
		</p>
		<p>
			This verse was revealed in connection with the marriage of Zaynab
			bint Jahsh and Zayd ibn al-Harithah which was arranged by the
			Prophet to show the egalitarian spirit of Islam. Zaynab at first
			was highly offended at the thought of marrying Zayd a former
			slave and refused to do so.  The Prophet prevailed upon them both
			and they were married.	The marriage however ended in divorce and
			Zaynab was eventually married to the Prophet himself. It is said
			that the Ansari girl read the verse to her parents and said:
		</p>
		<p>
			"I am satisfied and submit myself to whatever the Messenger of
			God deems good for me." The Prophet heard of her reaction and
			prayed for her: "O Lord, bestow good on her in abundance and make
			not her life one of toil and trouble."
		</p>
		<p>
			Among the Ansar, it is said there was not a more eligible bride
			than she. She was married by the Prophet to Julaybib and they
			lived together until he was killed.
		</p>
		<p>
			And how was Julaybib killed? He went on an expedition with the
			Prophet, peace be on him, and an encounter with some mushrikin
			ensued. When the battle was over, the Prophet asked his
			companions: "Have you lost anyone?" They replied giving the names
			of their relatives of close friends who were killed. He put the
			same questions to other companions and they also named the ones
			they had lost in the battle.  Another group answered that they
			had lost no close relative whereupon the Prophet said:
		</p>
		<p>
			"But I have lost Julaybib.  Search for him in the battlefield."
			They searched and found him beside seven mushrikin whom he had
			struck before meeting his end. The Prophet stood up and went to
			the spot where Julaybib, his short and deformed companion, lay.
			He stood over him and said: "He killed seven and then was killed?
			This (man) is of me and I am of him."
		</p>
		<p>
			He repeated this two or three times.  The Prophet then took him
			in his arms and it is said that he had no better bed  besides the
			forearms of the messenger of God. The Prophet then dug for him a
			grave and himself placed him in it. He did not wash him for
			martyrs are not washed before burial.
		</p>
		<p>
			Julaybib and his wife are not usually among the companions of the
			Prophet whose deeds are sung and whose	exploits are recounted
			with reverence and admiration as they should be. But in the
			meagre facts that are known about them and which have here been
			recounted we see how humble human beings were given hope and
			dignity by the Prophet where once there was only despair and
			self-debasement.
		</p>
		<p>
			The attitude of the unknown and unnamed Ansari girl who readily
			agreed to be the wife of a physically unattractive man was an
			attitude which reflected a profound understanding of Islam. It
			reflected on her part the effacement of personal desires and
			preferences even when she could have counted on the support of
			her parents.  It reflected on her part a total disregard for
			social pressures.  It reflected above all a ready and implicit
			confidence in the wisdom and authority of the Prophet in
			submitting herself to whatever he deemed good. This is the
			attitude of the true believer.
		</p>
		<p>
			In Julaybib, there is the example of a person who was almost
			regarded as a social outcast because of his appearance. Given
			help, confidence and encouragement by the noble Prophet, he was
			able to perform acts of courage and make the supreme sacrifice
			and deserve the commendation of the Prophet: "He is of me and I
			am of him."

	<biography name="Thabit ibn Qays">
		<p>
			Thabit ibn Qays was a chieftain of the Khazraj and therefore a
			man of considerable influence in Yathrib. He was known for the
			sharpness of his mind and the power of his oratory. It was
			because of this that he became the khatib or the spokesman and
			orator of the Prophet and Islam.
		</p>
		<p>
			He became a Muslim at the hands of Musab ibn Umayr whose cool and
			persuasive logic and the sweetness and beauty of his Quran
			recital proved irresistible.
		</p>
		<p>
			When the Prophet arrived in Madinah after the historic Hijrah,
			Thabit and a great gathering of horsemen gave him a warm and
			enthusiastic welcome. Thabit acted as their spokesman and
			delivered a speech in the presence of the Prophet and his
			companion, Abu Bakr as-Siddiq.	He began by giving praise to God
			Almighty and invoking peace and blessings on His Prophet and
			ended up by saying:
		</p>
		<p>
			"We give our pledge to you, O Messenger of God, that we would
			protect you from all that we protect ourselves, our children and
			our wives. What would then be our reward for this?"
		</p>
		<p>
			The speech was reminiscent of words spoken at the second Pledge
			of Aqabah and the Prophet's reply as then was the same:
			"Al-Jannah - Paradise!"
		</p>
		<p>
			When the Yathribites heard the word "al-Jannah" their faces
			beamed with happiness and excitement and their response was: "We
			are pleased, O Messenger of God! We are pleased, O Messenger of
			God ."
		</p>
		<p>
			From that day on the Prophet, peace be on him, made Thabit ibn
			Qays his Khatib, just as Hassan ibn Thabit was his poet. When
			delegations of Arabs came to him to show off their brilliance in
			verse and the strength of their oratory skills which the Arabs
			took great pride in, the Prophet would call upon Thabit ibn Qays
			to challenge their orators and Hassan ibn Thabit to vaunt his
			verses before their poets.
		</p>
		<p>
			In the Year of the Delegations, the ninth after the Hijrah,
			tribes from all over the Arabian peninsula came to Madinah to pay
			homage to the Prophet, either to announce their acceptance of
			Islam or to pay jizyah in return for the protection of the Muslim
			state. One of these was a delegation from the tribe of Tamim who
			said to the Prophet:
		</p>
		<p>
			"We have come to show our prowess to you. Do give
		</p>
		<p>
			permission to our Shaif and our Khatib to speak." The Prophet,
			peace be on him, smiled and said: "I permit your Khatib. Let him
			speak."
		</p>
		<p>
			Their orator, Utarid ibn Hajib, got up and held forth on the
			greatness and achievements of their tribe and when he was
			finished the Prophet summoned Thabit ibn Qays and said: "Stand
			and reply to him." Thabit arose and said:
		</p>
		<p>
			"Praise be to God Whose creation is the entire heavens and the
			earth wherein His will has been made manifest. His Throne is the
			extent of His knowledge and there is nothing which does not exist
			through His grace.
		</p>
		<p>
			"Through His power He has made us leaders and from the best of
			His creation He has chosen a Messenger who is the most honorable
			of men in lineage, the most reliable and true in speech and the
			most excellent in deeds. He has revealed to him a book and chosen
			him as a leader of His creation. Among all creation, he is a
			blessing of God.
		</p>
		<p>
			"He summoned people to have faith in Him. The Emigrants from
			among his people and his relations who are the most honorable
			people in esteem and the best in deeds believed in him. Then, we
			the Ansar (Helpers) were the first people to respond (to  his
			call for support). So we are the Helpers of God and the ministers
			of His Messenger."
		</p>
		<p>
			Thabit was a believer with a profound faith in God. His
			consciousness and fear of God was true and strong. He was
			especially sensitive and cautious of saying or doing anything
			that would incur the wrath of God Almighty. One day the Prophet
			saw him looking not just sad but dejected and afraid. His
			shoulders were haunched and he was actually cringing from fear.
		</p>
		<p>
			"What's wrong with you, O Abu Muhammad?" asked the Prophet. "I
			fear that I might be destroyed, O Messenger of God," he said.
			"And why?" asked the Prophet. "God Almighty," he said, "has
			prohibited us from desiring to be praised for what we did not do
			but I find myself liking praise. He has prohibited us from being
			proud and I find myself tending towards vanity." This was the
			time when the verse of the Quran was revealed: "Indeed, God does
			not love any arrogant boaster."
		</p>
		<p>
			The Prophet, peace be on him, then tried to calm his anxieties
			and allay his fears and eventually said to him: "O Thabit, aren't
			you pleased to live as someone who is praised, and to die as a
			martyr and to enter Paradise?"
		</p>
		<p>
			Thabit's face beamed with happiness and joy as he said:
			"Certainly, O Messenger of God." "Indeed, that shall be yours,"
			replied the noble Prophet.
		</p>
		<p>
			There was another occasion when Thabit became sad and
			crest-fallen, when the words of the Quran were revealed:
		</p>
		<p>
			"O you who believe! Raise not your voices above the voice of the
			Prophet and neither speak loudly to him as you would speak loudly
			to one another, lest all your deeds come to naught without your
			perceiving it."
		</p>
		<p>
			On hearing these words, Qays kept away from the meetings and
			gatherings of the Prophet in spite of his great love for him and
			his hitherto constant presence in his company. He stayed in his
			house a/most without ever leaving it except for the performance
			of the obligatory Salat. The Prophet missed his presence and
			evidently asked for information about him. A man from the Ansar
			volunteered and went to Thabit's house. He found Thabit sitting
			in his house, sad and dejected, with his head bowed low.
		</p>
		<p>
			"What's the matter with you?" asked the man. "It's bad," replied
			Thabit. "You know that I am a man with a loud voice and that my
			voice is far louder than that of the Messenger of God, may God
			bless him and grant him peace. And you know what has been
			revealed in the Quran. The only result for me is that my deeds
			will come to naught and I will be among the people who go to the
			fire of hell."
		</p>
		<p>
			The man returned to the Prophet and told him what he had seen and
			heard and the Prophet instructed him to return to Thabit and say:
			"You are not among the people who will go to the fire of hell but
			you will be among the people of Paradise."
		</p>
		<p>

			When the Prophet, peace be on him, returned to Madinah from the
			Farewell Pilgrimage in the tenth year after the Hijrah, he fell
			ill, News of his illness spread rapidly throughout the Arabian
			peninsula.  Sincere Muslims everywhere were greatly saddened by
			the news but for others it was a time to disclose hidden hopes
			and ambitions and reveal their real attitudes to Islam and the
			noble Prophet.
		</p>
		<p>
			In al-Yamamah, Musaylamah the Imposter renounced Islam. So too
			did Tulayhah al-Asadi in the land of the Asad. And in the Yemen,
			al-Aswad al-Ansi also became an apostate.  More than that, these
			three imposters claimed that they were prophets sent to their
			respective peoples just as Muhammad the son of Abdullah was sent
			to the Quraysh.
		</p>
		<p>
			Al-Aswad al-Ansi was a soothsayer who practised magic arts.  But
			he was no minor magician or fortuneteller who dabbled in his evil
			arts in obscurity. He was powerful and influential and possessed
			a strange power of speech that mesmerized the hearts of his
			listeners and captivated the minds of the masses with his false
			claims. With his wealth and power he managed to attract not just
			the masses but people of status as well. When he appeared before
			people he normally wore a mask in order to surround himself with
			an air of mystery, awe and reverence.
		</p>
		<p>
			In the Yemen at that time, a section of the people who had much
			prestige and influence were the "Abna". They were the scions of
			Persian fathers who ruled Yemen as part of the Sasanian Empire.
			Their mothers were local Arabs.  Fayruz al-Daylami was one of
			these Yemeni Abna.
		</p>
		<p>
			At the time of the appearance of Islam, the most powerful of the
			Abna was Badhan who ruled Yemen on behalf of the Chosroes of
			Persia. When Badban became convinced of the truth of the Prophet
			Muhammad and the Divine nature of his mission he renounced his
			allegiance to the Chosroes and accepted Islam.	His people
			followed him in tiffs. The Prophet confirmed him in his dominion
			and he ruled the Yemen until his death shortly before the
			appearance of al-Aswad al-Ansi.
		</p>
		<p>
			Al-Aswad's tribe, the Banu Mudh-hij, were the first to respond
			positively to his claims to prophethood. With this tribal force
			he mounted a raid on San'a. He killed the governor, Shahr the son
			of Badhan and took his wife to himself. From San'a he raided
			other regions. Through his swift and startling strikes, a vast
			region from Hadramawt to at-Taif and from al-Ahsa to Aden came
			under his influence.
		</p>
		<p>
			What helped al-Aswad in deceiving the people and drawing them to
			him was his guile and cunning which knew no bounds.  To his
			followers he alleged that an angel visited him, disclosed
			revelations to him and gave him intelligence of people and their
			affairs. What allowed him to appear to bear out these claims were
			the spies he employed and despatched everywhere, to bring him
			news of people and their circumstances, their secrets and their
			problems, their hopes and their fears.
		</p>
		<p>
			Reports were brought back in secrecy to him and when he met
			anyone, especially those in need, he could give the impression
			that he had prior knowledge of their needs and problems. In this
			way he astonished people and confounded their thoughts. He
			acquired a large following and his mission spread like wildfire.
		</p>
		<p>
			When news of al-Aswad's apostasy and his activities throughout
			the Yemen reached the Prophet, peace be on him, he despatched
			about ten of Iris companions with letters to those of his
			companions in the Yemen whom he felt he could trust. He urged
			them to confront the blind fitnah with faith and resolve, and he
			ordered them to get rid of al-Aswad by any means possible.
		</p>
		<p>
			All who received the Prophet's missives set about to carry out
			his orders implicitly. In the forefront of these was Fayruz
			ad-Daylami and those of the Abna who were with him. Let us leave
			Fayruz to relate his extraordinary story:
		</p>
		<p>
			"I and those of the Abna who were with me never for one moment
			had any doubt about the religion of God. No belief in the enemy
			of God entered the heart of any one of us. (In fact) we waited
			for opportunities to get hold of al-Aswad and eliminate him by
			any means.
		</p>
		<p>
			When we received the letters of the Messenger of God, may God
			bless him and grant him peace, we felt strengthened in our mutual
			resolve and each one determined to do what he could
		</p>
		<p>
			Because of his considerable success, pride and vanity took hold
			of al-Aswad al-Ansi.   He bragged to the commander of his army,
			Qays ibn Abd Yaghuth, saying how powerful he was.  His attitude
			and relationship towards his commander changed so much so that
			Qays felt that he was not safe from Iris violence and oppression.
		</p>
		<p>
			My cousin, Dadhawayh, and I went to Qays and informed him of what
			the Prophet, peace and blessings be on him, had told us and we
			invited him to "make lunch" out of the man (al-Aswad) before he
			could "make supper" out of him.  He was receptive to our proposal
			and regarded us as a Godsend. He disclosed to us some of the
			secrets of al-Aswad.
		</p>
		<p>
			The three of us vowed to confront the apostate from within (his
			castle) while our other brothers would confront him from without.
			We were all of the view that our cousin Dadha, whom al-Aswad had
			taken to himself after the killing of her husband, should join
			us. We went to al-Aswad's castle and met her. I said to her:
		</p>
		<p>
			'O cousin, you know what harm and evil this man has visited upon
			you and us.  He has killed your husband and dishonored the women
			of your people. He has massacred their husbands and wrested
			political authority from their hands.
		</p>
		<p>
			'This is a letter from the Messenger of God, may God bless him
			and grant him peace, to us in particular and to the people of
			Yemen in general in which he asks us to put an end to this
			fitnah.  Would you help us in this matter?' 'On what can I help
			you? she asked. 'On his expulsion...' I said. 'Rather on his
			assassination,' she suggested. 'By God, I had nothing else in
			mind,' I said, 'but I was afraid to suggest this to you.' 'By Him
			Who has sent Muhammad with the Truth as a bringer or' good
			tidings and as a warner, I have not doubted in my religion for a
			moment.  God has not created a man more detestable to me than the
			devil (al-Aswad).  By God, from the time I saw him, I have only
			known him to be a corrupt and sinful person who does not promote
			any truth and does not stop from committing any abominable deed.'
			"How can we go about eliminating him?' I asked.
		</p>
		<p>
			'He is well-guarded and protected.  There is not a place in his
			castle which is not surrounded by guards. There is one broken
			down and abandoned room though which opens out into open land. In
			the evening during the first third of the night, go there. You
			will find inside weapons and a light. You will find me waiting
			for you...' she said.
		</p>
		<p>
			'But getting through to a room in a castle such as this is no
			easy task. Someone might pass and alert the guards and that will
			be the end of us' I said. 'You are not far from the truth. But I
			have a suggestion.' 'What is it?' I asked.
		</p>
		<p>
			'Send a man tomorrow whom you trust as one of the workers.  I
			shall tell him to make an opening in the room from the inside so
			that it should be easy to enter.' 'That's a brilliant suggestion
			you have,' I said.
		</p>
		<p>
			I then left her and told the two others what we had decided and
			they gave their blessings to the plan. We left straightaway to
			get ourselves prepared. We informed a select group of believers
			who were assisting us to prepare themselves and gave them the
			password (to signal the time they could storm the castle). The
			time was to be dawn of the following day.
		</p>
		<p>
			When night fell and the appointed time came, I went with my two
			companions to the opening in the room and uncovered it. We
			entered the room and put on the lamp.  We found the weapons and
			proceeded to the apartment of God's enemy. There was our cousin
			standing at his door. She pointed out where he was and we
			entered. He was asleep and snoring. I plunged the blade in his
			neck and he bellowed like a bull being slaughtered. When the
			guards heard this, they ran quickly to his apartment and asked:
			'What is this?'
		</p>
		<p>
			'Don't worry.  You can go. The prophet of God is receiving
			revelation,' she said, and they left. We stayed in the castle
			until the break of dawn. Then I stood on a wall of the castle and
			shouted:
		</p>
		<p>
			'Allahu Akbar! Allahu Akbar!' and went on with the adhan until I
			reached':  'Ashhadu anna Muhammadur Rasulullah ! (Then I added)
			'Wa ashhadu anna al Aswad al-Ansi kadh-dhab !	 I testify  that
			al-Aswad is an imposter.'
		</p>
		<p>
			That was the password, Muslims then converged on
		</p>
		<p>
			the castle from every direction. The guards took fright
		</p>
		<p>
			when they heard the adhan and were confronted by the
		</p>
		<p>
			Muslims shouting Allahu Akbar.
		</p>
		<p>
			By sunrise, the mission was accomplished.  When it was full
			light, we sent a letter to the Messenger of God giving him the
			good news of the death of God's enemy.
		</p>
		<p>
			When the messengers reached Madinah they found that the Prophet,
			may the blessings of God be on him, had passed away that very
			night. They learned however that Revelation had been communicated
			to the Prophet informing him of the death of al-Aswad al-Ansi the
			night it took place."
		</p>
		<p>
			Years later, the Khalifah Umar ibn al-Khattab wrote to Fayruz
			ad-Daylami, may God be pleased with them both, saying:
		</p>
		<p>
			"I have heard that you are busy eating white bread and honey
			(meaning no doubt that he was leading an easy life). When this my
			letter reaches you, come to me with the blessings of God so that
			you may campaign in the path of God."
		</p>
		<p>
			Fayruz did as he was commanded. He went to Madinah and sought an
			audience with Umar. Umar granted him permission. Evidently there
			was a crowd waiting to see Umar and a Quraysh youth pushed
			Fayruz. Fayruz raised his hand and hit the Quraysh youth on the
			nose.
		</p>
		<p>
			The youth went to Umar who asked: "Who did that to you?"
		</p>
		<p>
			"Fayruz. He is at the door," said the youth. Fayruz entered and
			Umar asked: "What is this, O Fayruz?"
		</p>
		<p>
			"O Amir al-Muminin," said Fayruz. "You wrote to me.  You didn't
			write to him. You gave me permission to enter and you didn't give
			him permission. He wanted to enter in my turn before me. Then I
			did what you have been told."
		</p>
		<p>
			"Al-Qisas," pronounced Umar in judgment, meaning that Fayruz had
			to receive the same blow from the youth in retaliation. "Must it
			be so?" asked Fayruz. "It must be so," insisted Umar.
		</p>
		<p>
			Fayruz then got down on his knees and the youth stood up to exact
			his retaliation.  Umar said to him then: "Wait a moment, young
			man, so that I can tell you something which I heard from the
			Messenger of God, may God bless him and grant him peace. I heard
			the Messenger of God say one evening: 'This night, al-Aswad
			al-Ansi the Imposter has been killed.  The righteous servant
			Fayruz ad-Daylami has killed him' Umar then asked the youth:
		</p>
		<p>
			"Do you see yourself taking retribution on him after you have
			heard this from the Messenger of God?" "I forgive him," said the
			youth, "after you have told me this from the Prophet." "Do you
			think," said Fayruz to Umar, "that my escape from what I have
			done is a confession to him and that his forgiveness is not given
			under duress?" "Yes," replied Umar and Fayruz then declared: "I
			testily to you that my sword, my horse and thirty thousand of my
			money is a gift to him."
		</p>
		<p>
			"Your forgiveness has paid off, O brother Quraysh and you have
			become rich," said Umar no doubt impressed by the sense of
			remorse and the spontaneous generosity of Fayruz, the righteous.

	<biography name="Abdullah ibn Umar">
		<p>
			At Shaykhan, halfway between Madinah and Uhud, the thousand
			strong Muslim army led by the Prophet stopped. The sun had begun
			to sink beneath the horizon. The Prophet dismounted from his
			horse Sakb. He was fully dressed for battle. A turban was wound
			about his helmet. He wore a breastplate beneath which was a coat
			of mail which was fastened with a leather sword belt. A shield
			was slung across his back and his  sword hung from his side.
		</p>
		<p>
			As the sun set, Bilal called the adhan and they prayed. The
			Prophet then reviewed his troops once more and it was then that
			he noticed in their midst the presence of eight boys who despite
			their age were hoping to take part in the battle. Among them were
			Zayd's son Usamah and Umar's son Abdullah, both only thirteen
			years old. The Prophet ordered them all to return home
			immediately. Two of the boys however demonstrated that they were
			able fighters and were allowed to accompany the army to the
			Battle of Uhud while the others were sent back to their families.
		</p>
		<p>
			From an early age, Abdullah ibn Umar thus demonstrated his
			keenness to be associated with the Prophet in all his
			undertakings.  He had accepted Islam before he was ten years old
			and had made the Hijrah with his father and his sister, Hafsah,
			who was later to become a wife of the Prophet. Before Uhud he was
			also turned away from the Battle of Badr and it was not until the
			Battle of the Ditch the he and Usamah, both now fifteen years old
			and others of their age were allowed to join the ranks of the men
			not only for the digging of the trench but for the battle when it
			came.
		</p>
		<p>
			From the time of his hijrah till the time of his death more than
			seventy years later, Abdullah ibn Umar distinguished himself in
			the service of Islam and was regarded among Muslims as "the Good
			One, son of the Good One", according to Abu Musa al-Ashari. He
			was known for his knowledge, his humility, his generosity, his
			piety, his truthfulness, his incorruptibility and his constancy
			in acts of ibadah.
		</p>
		<p>
			From his great and illustrious father, Umar, he learnt a great
			deal and both he and his father had the benefit of learning from
			the greatest teacher of all, Muhammad the Messenger of God. 
			Abdullah would observe and scrutinize closely every saying and
			action of the Prophet in various situations and he would practise
			what he observed closely and with devotion.  For example, if
			Abdullah saw the Prophet performing Salat in a particular place,
			he would later pray in the same place. If he saw the Prophet
			making a supplication while standing, he would also make a dua
			while standing.  If he saw him making a dua while sitting, he
			would do the same. On a journey if he saw the Prophet descend
			from his camel at a particular place and pray two rakats, and he
			had occasion to pass on the same route, he would stop at the same
			place and pray two rakats. In a particular place in Makkah, he
			once observed the Prophet's camel making two complete turns
			before he dismounted and prayed two rakats. It might be that the
			camel did that involuntarily but Abdullah ibn Umar when he
			happened to be in the same place at another time, made his camel
			complete two turns before making it kneel and dismounting. He
			then prayed two rakats in precisely the same manner as he had
			seen the Prophet do.
		</p>
		<p>
			Aishah, may God be pleased with her, noticed this devotion of
			Abdullah to the Prophet and remarked: "There was no one who
			followed the footsteps of the Prophet, may God bless him and
			grant him peace, in the places where he alighted as did Ibn
			Umar."
		</p>
		<p>
			In spite of his close observance of the Prophet's actions,
			Abdullah was extremely cautious, even afraid, of reporting the
			sayings of the Prophet. He would only relate a hadith if he was
			completely sure that he remembered every word of it. One of his
			contemporaries said:
		</p>
		<p>
			"Among the companions of the Prophet, no one was more cautious
			about adding to or subtracting from the hadith of the Prophet
			than Abdullah ibn Umar."
		</p>
		<p>
			Similarly he was extremely cautious and reluctant to make legal
			judgments (fatwas).' Once someone came to him asking for a
			judgment on a particular matter and Abdullah ibn Umar replied: "I
			have no knowledge of what you ask." The man went on his way and
			Abdullah clapped his hands in glee and said to himself: "The son
			of Umar was asked about what he does not know and he said: I do
			not know."
		</p>
		<p>
			Because of this attitude he was reluctant to be a qadi even
			though he was well qualified to be one. The position of qadi was
			one of the most important and esteemed offices in the Muslim
			society and state bringing with it honor, glory and even riches
			but he declined this position when it was offered him by the
			Khalifah Uthman. His reason for so doing was not that he
			underestimated the importance of the position of qadi but because
			of his fear of committing errors of judgment in matters
			pertaining to Islam. Uthman made him agree not to disclose his
			decision lest it might influence the many other companions of the
			Prophet who actually performed the duties of judges and juris
			consults.
		</p>
		<p>
			Abdullah ibn Umar was once described as the "brother of the
			night."  He would stay up at night performing Salat, weeping and
			seeking God's forgiveness and reading Quran. To his sister,
			Hafsah, the Prophet once said: "What a blessed man is Abdullah.
			Should he perform Salat at night he would be blessed even more."
		</p>
		<p>
			From that day, Abdullah did not abandon aiyam alLayl whether at
			home or on journeys. In the stillness of the nights, he would
			remember God much, perform Salat and read the Quran and weep. 
			Like his father, tears came readily to his eyes especially when
			he heard the warning verses of the Quran. Ubayd ibn Umayr has
			related that one day he read these verses to Abdullah ibn Umar:
		</p>
		<p>
			"How then (will the sinners fare on Judgment Day) when We shall
			bring forward witnesses from within every community and bring you
			(O Prophet) as witness against them? Those who were bent on
			denying the truth and paid no heed to the Apostle will on that
			Day wish that the earth would swallow them but they shall not (be
			able to) conceal from God anything that has happened." (Surah
			an-Nisa, 4:41-42).
		</p>
		<p>
			Abdullah cried on listening to these verses until his beard was
			moist with tears. One day, he was sitting among some close
			friends and he read: "Woe unto those who give short measure,
			those who, when they are to receive their due from people, demand
			that it be given in full but when they have to measure or weigh
			whatever they owe to others, give less than what is due.  Do they
			not know that they are bound to be raised from the dead (and
			called to account) on an awesome Day, the Day when all men shall
			stand before the Sustainer of all the worlds?"	(The Quran, Surah
			al Mutaffifin, 83: 1-6). At this point he kept on repeating "the
			Day when all men shall stand before the Sustainer of all the
			worlds" over and over again and weeping until he was faint.
		</p>
		<p>
			Piety, simplicity and generosity combined in Abdullah to make him
			a person who was highly esteemed by the companions and those who
			came after them. He gave generously and did not mind parting with
			wealth even if he himself would fall in want as a result.  He was
			a successful and trustworthy trader throughout his life. In
			addition to this he had a generous stipend from the Bayt al-Mal
			which he would often spend on the poor and those in need. Ayyub
			ibn Wail ar-Rasi recounted one incident of his generosity:
		</p>
		<p>
			One day Umar received four thousand dirhams and a velvet blanket.
			 The following day Ayyub saw him in the suq buying fodder for his
			camel on credit. Ayyub then went to Abdullah's family and asked:
		</p>
		<p>
			"Didn't Abu Abdur-Rahman (meaning Abdullah ibn Umar) get four
			thousand dirhams and a blanket yesterday?" "Yes, indeed," they
			replied.
		</p>
		<p>
			"But I saw him today in the suq buying fodder for his camel and
			he had no money to pay for it." "Before nightfall yesterday. he
			had parted with it all. Then he took the blanket and threw it
			over his shoulder and went out. When he returned it was not with
			him. We asked him about it and he said that he had given it to a
			poor person," they explained.
		</p>
		<p>
			Abdullah ibn Umar encouraged the feeding and the helping of the
			poor and the needy. Often when he ate, there were orphans and
			poor people eating with him. He rebuked his children for treating
			the rich and ignoring the poor. He once said to them: "You invite
			the rich and forsake the poor."
		</p>
		<p>
			For Abdullah, wealth was a servant not a master. It was a means
			towards attaining the necessities of life, not for acquiring
			luxuries.  He was helped in this attitude by his asceticism and
			simple life-style. One of his friends who came from Khurasan once
			brought him a fine elegant piece of clothing:
		</p>
		<p>
			"I have brought this thawb for you from Khurasan," he said. "It
			would certainly bring coolness to your eyes. I suggest that you
			take off these coarse clothes you have and put on this beautiful
			thawb."
		</p>
		<p>
			"Show it to me then," said Abdullah and on touching it he asked:
			"Is it silk?" "No, it is cotton," replied his friend.
		</p>
		<p>
			For a little while, Abdullah was pleased. Then with his right
			hand he pushed away the thawb and said: "No! I am afraid for
			myself. I fear that it shall make arrogant and boastful. And God
			does not love the arrogant boaster."
		</p>
		<p>
			Maymun ibn Mahran relates the following: "I entered the house of
			Ibn Umar. I estimated everything in his house including his bed,
			his blanket, his carpet and everything else in it. What I found
			was not a hundred dirhams' worth."
		</p>
		<p>
			That was not because Abdullah ibn Umar was poor. Indeed he was
			rich.  Neither was it because he was a miser for indeed he was
			generous and liberal.

	<biography name="Aishah bint Abi Bakr">
		<p>
			The life of Aishah is proof that a woman can be far more learned
			than men and that she can be the teacher of scholars and experts.
			 Her life is also proof that a woman can exert influence over men
			and women and provide them with inspiration and leadership. Her
			life is also proof that the same woman can be totally feminine
			and be a source of pleasure, joy and comfort to her husband.
		</p>
		<p>
			She did not graduate from any university there were no
			universities as such in her day.  But still her utterances are
			studied in faculties of literature, her legal pronouncements are
			studied in colleges of law and her life and works are studied and
			researched by students and teachers of Muslim history as they
			have been for over a thousand years.
		</p>
		<p>
			The bulk of her vast treasure of knowledge was obtained while she
			was still quite young. In her early childhood she was brought up
			by her father who was greatly liked and respected for he was a
			man of wide knowledge, gentle manners and an agreeable presence.
			Moreover he was the closest friend of the noble Prophet who was a
			frequent visitor to their home since the very early days of his
			mission.
		</p>
		<p>
			In her youth, already known for her striking beauty and her
			formidable memory, she came under the loving care and attention
			of the Prophet himself. As his wife and close companion she
			acquired from him knowledge and insight such as no woman has ever
			acquired.
		</p>
		<p>
			Aishah became the Prophet's wife in Makkah when she was most
			likely in the tenth year of her life but her wedding did not take
			place until the second year after the Hijrah when she was about
			fourteen or fifteen years old.	Before and after her wedding she
			maintained a natural jollity and innocence and did not seem at
			all overawed by the thought of being wedded to him who was the
			Messenger of God whom all his companions, including her own
			mother and father, treated with such love and reverence as they
			gave to no one else.
		</p>
		<p>
			About her wedding, she related that shortly before she was to
			leave her parent's house, she slipped out into the courtyard to
			play with a passing friend:
		</p>
		<p>
			"I was playing on a see-saw and my long streaming hair was
			dishevelled," she said. "They came and took me from my play and
			made me ready."
		</p>
		<p>
			They dressed her in a wedding-dress made from fine red-striped
			cloth from Bahrain and then her mother took her to the
			newly-built house where some women of the Ansar were waiting
			outside the door. They greeted her with the words "For good and
			for happiness may all be well!" Then, in the presence of the
			smiling Prophet, a bowl of milk was brought. The Prophet drank
			from it himself and offered it to Aishah. She shyly declined it
			but when he insisted she did so and then offered the bowl to her
			sister Asma who was sitting beside her. Others also drank of it
			and that was as much as there was of the simple and solemn
			occasion of their wedding. There was no wedding feast.
		</p>
		<p>
			Marriage to the Prophet did not change her playful ways.  Her
			young friends came regularly to visit her in her own apartment.
		</p>
		<p>
			"I would be playing with my dolls," she said, "with the girls who
			were my friends, and the Prophet would come in and they would
			slip out of the house and he would go out after them and bring
			them back, for he was pleased for my sake to have them there."
			Sometimes he would say "Stay where you are" before they had time
			to leave, and would also join in their games. Aishah said: "One
			day, the Prophet came in when I was playing with the dolls and he
			said: 'O Aishah, whatever game is this?' 'It is Solomon's
			horses,' I said and he laughed." Sometimes as he came in he would
			screen himself with his cloak so as not to disturb Aishah and her
			friends.
		</p>
		<p>
			Aishah's early life in Madinah also had its more serious and
			anxious times.	Once her father and two companions who were
			staying with him fell ill with a dangerous fever which was common
			in Madinah at certain seasons.	One morning Aishah went to visit
			him and was dismayed to find the three men lying completely weak
			and exhausted. She asked her father how he was and he answered
			her in verse but she did not understand what he was saying. The
			two others also answered her with lines of poetry which seemed to
			her to be nothing but unintelligible babbling.	She was deeply
			troubled and went home to the Prophet saying:
		</p>
		<p>
			"They are raving, out of their minds, through the heat of the
			fever." The Prophet asked what they had said and was somewhat
			reassured when she repeated almost word for word the lines they
			had uttered and which made sense although she did not fully
			understand them then.  This was a demonstration of the great
			retentive power of her memory which as the years went by were to
			preserve so many of the priceless sayings of the Prophet.
		</p>
		<p>
			Of the Prophet's wives in Madinah, it was clear that it was
			Aishah that he loved most. From time to time, one or the other of
			his companions would ask:
		</p>

			"O Messenger of God, whom do you love most in the world?" He did
			not always give the same answer to this question for he felt
			great love for many  for his daughters and their children, for
			Abu Bakr, for Ali, for Zayd and his son Usamah. But of his wives
			the only one he named in this connection was Aishah. She too
			loved him greatly in return and often would seek reassurance from
			him that he loved her. Once she asked him: "How is your love for
			me?"
		</p>
		<p>
			"Like the rope's knot," he replied meaning that it was strong and
			secure. And time after time thereafter, she would ask him: "How
			is the knot?" and he would reply: "Ala haaliha	 in the same
			condition."
		</p>
		<p>
			As she loved the Prophet so was her love a jealous love and she
			could not bear the thought that the Prophet's attentions should
			be given to others more than seemed enough to her. She asked him:
		</p>
		<p>
			"O Messenger of God, tell me of yourself.  If you were between
			the two slopes of a valley, one of which had not been grazed
			whereas the other had been grazed, on which would you pasture
			your flocks?"
		</p>
		<p>
			"On that which had not been grazed," replied the Prophet. "Even
			so," she said,	"and I am not as any other of your wives.
			"Everyone of them had a husband before you, except myself." The
			Prophet smiled and said nothing. Of her jealousy, Aishah would
			say in later years:
		</p>
		<p>
			"I was not, jealous of any other wife of the Prophet as I was
			jealous of Khadijah, because of his constant mentioning of her
			and because God had commanded him to give her good tidings of a
			mansion in Paradise of precious stones.  And whenever he
			sacrificed a sheep he would send a fair portion of it to those
			who had been her intimate friends.  Many a time I said to him:
			"It is as if there had never been any other woman in the world
			except Khadijah."
		</p>
		<p>
			Once, when Aishah complained and asked why he spoke so highly of
			"an old Quraysh woman", the Prophet was hurt and said: "She was
			the wife who believed in me when others rejected me. When people
			gave me the lie, she affirmed my truthfulness. When I stood
			forsaken, she spent her wealth to lighten the burden of my
			sorrow.."
		</p>
		<p>
			Despite her feelings of jealousy which nonetheless were not of a
			destructive kind, Aishah was really a generous soul and a patient
			one. She bore with the rest of the Prophet's household poverty
			and hunger which often lasted for long periods. For days on end
			no fire would be lit in the sparsely furnished house of the
			Prophet for cooking or baking bread and they would live merely on
			dates and water. Poverty did not cause her distress or
			humiliation; self-sufficiency when it did come did not corrupt
			her style of life.
		</p>
		<p>
			Once the Prophet stayed away from his wives for a month because
			they had distressed him by asking of him that which he did not
			have. This was after the Khaybar expedition when an increase of
			riches whetted the appetite for presents. Returning from his
			self-imposed retreat, he went first to Aishah's apartment. She
			was delighted to see him but he said he had received Revelation
			which required him to put two options before her. He then recited
			the verses:
		</p>
		<p>
			"O Prophet! Say to your wives: If you desire the life of this
			world and its adornments, then come and I will bestow its goods
			upon you, and I will release you with a fair release.  But if you
			desire God and His Messenger and the abode of the Hereafter, then
			verily God has laid in store for you an immense reward for such
			as you who do good."
		</p>
		<p>
			Aishah's reply was:
		</p>
		<p>
			"Indeed I desire God and His Messenger and the abode of the
			Hereafter," and her response was followed by all the others.
		</p>
		<p>
			She stuck to her choice both during the lifetime of the Prophet
			and afterwards. Later when the Muslims were favored with enormous
			riches, she was given a gift of one hundred thousand dirhams. She
			was fasting when she received the money and she distributed the
			entire amount to the poor and the needy even though she had no
			provisions in her house. Shortly after, a maidservant said to
			her: "Could you buy meat for a dirham with which to break your
			fast?"
		</p>
		<p>
			"If I had remembered, I would have done so," she said. The
			Prophet's affection for Aishah remained to the last.  During his
			final illness, it was to Aishah's apartment that he went at the
			suggestion of his wives. For much of the time he lay there on a
			couch with his head resting on her breast or on her lap. She it
			was who took a toothstick from her brother, chewed upon it to
			soften it and gave it to the Prophet. Despite his weakness, he
			rubbed his teeth with it vigorously. Not long afterwards, he lost
			consciousness and Aishah thought it was the onset of death, but
			after an hour he opened his eyes.
		</p>
		<p>
			Aishah it is who has preserved for us these dying moments of the
			most honoured of God's creation, His beloved Messenger may He
			shower His choicest blessings on him.
		</p>
		<p>
			When he opened his eyes again, Aishah remembered Iris having said
			to her: "No Prophet is taken by death until he has been shown his
			place in Paradise and then offered the choice, to live or die."
		</p>
		<p>
			"He will not now choose us," she said to herself. Then she heard
			him murmur: "With the supreme communion in Paradise, with those
			upon whom God has showered His favor, the Prophets, the martyrs
			and the righteous..." Again she heard him murmur: "O Lord, with
			the supreme communion," and these were the last words she heard
			him speak. Gradually his head grew heavier upon her breast, until
			others in the room began to lament, and Aishah laid his head on a
			pillow and joined them in lamentation.
		</p>
		<p>
			In the floor of Aishah's room near the couch where he was lying,
			a grave was dug in which was buried the Seal of the Prophets amid
			much bewilderment and great sorrow.
		</p>
		<p>
			Aishah lived on almost fifty years after the passing away of the
			Prophet. She had been his wife for a decade. Much of this time
			was spent in learning and acquiring knowledge of the two most
			important sources of God's guidance, the Quran and the Sunnah of
			His Prophet. Aishah was one of three wives (the other two being
			Hafsah and Umm Salamah) who memorized the Revelation. Like
			Hafsah, she had her own script of the Quran written after the
			Prophet had died.
		</p>
		<p>
			So far as the Ahadith or sayings of the Prophet is concerned,
			Aishah is one of four persons (the others being Abu Hurayrah,
			Abdullah ibn Umar, and Anas ibn Malik) who transmitted more than
			two thousand sayings. Many of these pertain to some of the most
			intimate aspects of personal behavior which only someone in
			Aishah's position could have learnt. What is most important is
			that her knowledge of hadith was passed on in written form by at
			least three persons including her nephew Urwah who became one of
			the greatest scholars among the generation after the Companions.
		</p>
		<p>
			Many of the learned companions of the Prophet and their followers
			benefitted from Aishah's knowledge. Abu Musa al-Ashari once said:
			"If we companions of the Messenger of God had any difficulty on a
			matter, we asked Aishah about it."
		</p>
		<p>
			Her nephew Urwah asserts that she was proficient not only in fiqh
			but also in medicine (tibb) and poetry. Many of the senior
			companions of the Prophet came to her to ask for advice
			concerning questions of inheritance which required a highly
			skilled mathematical mind. Scholars regard her as one of the
			earliest fuqaha of Islam along with persons like Umar ibn
			al-Khattab, Ali and Abdullah ibn Abbas. The Prophet referring to
			her extensive knowledge of Islam is reported to have said: "Learn
			a portion of your religion (din) from this red colored lady." 
			"Humayra" meaning "Red-coloured" was an epithet given to Aishah
			by the Prophet.
		</p>
		<p>
			Aishah not only possessed great knowledge but took an active part
			in education and social reform.  As a teacher she had a clear and
			persuasive manner of speech and her power of oratory has been
			described in superlative terms by al-Ahnaf who said: "I have
			heard speeches of Abu Bakr and Umar, Uthman and Ali and the
			Khulafa up to this day, but I have not heard speech more
			persuasive and more beautiful from the mouth of any person than
			from the mouth of Aishah."
		</p>
		<p>
			Men and women came from far and wide to benefit from her
			knowledge. The number of women is said to have been greater than
			that of men. Besides answering enquiries, she took boys and
			girls, some of them orphans, into her custody and trained them
			under her care and guidance.  This was in addition to her
			relatives who received instruction from her. Her house thus
			became a school and an academy.
		</p>
		<p>
			Some of her students were outstanding.	We have already mentioned
			her nephew Urwah as a distinguished reporter of hadith.  Among
			her women pupils is the name of Umrah bint Abdur Rahman. She is
			regarded by scholars as one of the trustworthy narrators of
			hadith and is said to have acted as Aishah's secretary receiving
			and replying to letters addressed to her. The example of Aishah
			in promoting education and in particular the education of Muslim
			women in the laws and teachings of Islam is one which needs to be
			followed.
		</p>
		<p>
			After Khadijah al-Kubra (the Great) and Fatimah az-Zahra (the
			Resplendent), Aishah as-Siddiqah (the one who affirms the Truth)
			is regarded as the best woman in Islam. Because of the strength
			of her personality, she was a leader in every field  in
			knowledge, in society, in politics and in war. She often
			regretted her involvement in war but lived long enough to regain
			position as the most respected woman of her time. She died in the
			year 58 AH in the month of Ramadan and as she instructed, was
			buried in the Jannat al-Baqi in the City of Light, beside other
			companions of the Prophet.
